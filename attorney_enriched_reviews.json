          "text": "Lisa successfully handled a NYC record sealing for me in much less time than was expected. She is an excellent attorney. I have dealt with many attorneys in my life and Lisa is different. Many attorneys just take your money and then it is hard to even get them on the phone or cases drag on and on from lack of attention. Not Lisa, whenever I called her she responded right away and is very competent. She is experienced and knows the system. I highly recommend Lisa",

          "text": "My minor stepson got in a little trouble last year, and we needed a lawyer fast. From a bench in the lobby of the police precinct I went on Avvo to look for the best defense lawyer, and Julie's name came up. I called the number (this was maybe 7 am) and got a text and call back from Katie Fernandez in less than 5 minutes. We explained what was going on, and she immediately called the precinct to let them know she was representing my stepson and to get more info on his arrest from them. Later that day she was able to get him released to us, and worked to build his defense case. She argued to get the case moved to family court, and ultimately all charges were dropped and his records sealed after a 3 month period with the only condition being that he didn't get into any more trouble. Julie and Katie were fully invested in the best possible outcome for my stepson, even checking in a few times afterwards to see how he was doing. We're so, so happy with the work they did, and can't recommend them enough.",

Not realizing the law in New York and accidentally having taken his firearm with him from Florida on a boat he sailed to NYC for training, TSA stopped him when he put his bag through screening to fly home. He had no intention of hiding anything or breaking the law but the port authority police handcuffed him and took him into custody for what was an honest mistake. Fast forward, my family found Jeremy. He was calm and reassuring during one of the most difficult times in our lives. He explained what he thought would happen and how he would get past the felony charge without serving jail time. He even was able to maintain my husband's clean record, clean! Jeremy never promised a result but he did promise he would work hard.  Though he was busy at times he answered all of our questions (sometimes we would tag team with questions) and calmed our nerves. Most importantly, in the end Jeremy delivered just like he said he would.\n\nThe lesson that is most important is don't forget to take any weapons out of your bag when travelling through the airport (especially in New York!) The penalties are real!!! The second lesson is if you do, consider Jeremy. My family and I are glad that we did!",

My case initially started with a restraining order. It then went to three felonies (two being violent felonies) and a restraining order. I literally saw my life drastically changing for the worst right before my eyes. Brian had the courage to pick up both of my cases. The victim, who was my ex girlfriend, was doing everything in her power to make my life miserable and put me in jail for a long time. While Brian did not promise an end result, he promised that he would fight hard for the best outcome for me. There were many plot twists and turns throughout my case and during the restraining order process. Brian was able to weave through all of them and use his knowledge to get us out unscathed. It was obvious that Brian had many years of experience in the courtroom. He appeared to be well known, which is always a plus. He always came in professionally suited as well as his team. Brian saved my job and my future! After almost two long years, I am extremely happy to announce that I only have one NON VIOLENT misdemeanor and NO felonies! I am able to have my misdemeanor expunged in one year. I was never put on probation during or after the process. If you are reading my review, I HIGHLY recommend that you STOP looking elsewhere and hire this savvy man! He gave me hope in one of the darkest times of my life. I cannot brag on him enough! Thank you, Brian for all that you did for me. I appreciate you immensely and have a high level of respect for you!\n\nHire him NOW!\n\nBest regards,\nShemiah",

Collin filed a Writ of Habeas Corpus on my behalf and successfully got my previous case dismissed\u2014a case that was far from easy.\n\nWhen I first reached out to him, I was lost, depressed, and unable to see a way out of the situation I was in. Collin\u2019s extensive knowledge of the law, unwavering determination, and strategic approach turned everything around. He not only gave me hope but delivered results beyond my expectations.\n\nCollin is also currently in the process of expunging my case, and I have no doubt that he and his team will accomplish this as well. Their professionalism, expertise, and dedication to their clients are unmatched.\n\nIf you\u2019re in need of a criminal defense attorney, I wholeheartedly recommend Collin Evans and his team. They are compassionate, professional, and truly outstanding at what they do. They genuinely fight for their clients, and I am forever grateful for their hard work and commitment.\n\nI'd give Collin Evans 10 stars if I could. Thank you again Mr. Evans!",

I went to court the first day and met Attorney Trinidad Zamora III, who was there at every single time at court. & he fought for me as well as reassured me that everything was going to be okay. From that day on, he made sure he came through on his word to give me. Attorney Trinidad made sure I was going to get a second chance at life, & to be able to accomplish every single goal & dream I hoped for -- from my career to my family to being able to travel to even being able to be a part of my church entirely all-in. Ms. Cecilia Rodriguez, also a part of The Law Offices of Jed Silverman, was very informant, very communicative, & very prompt -- updating me with my case & what I needed to do on my part. She is so kind & patient & works really hard. They were always available if I had any questions or even any worry about the case & even my future. They are very professional, eloquent and very understandable. I mean, they were really patient with me in regards to my case, fees, life situations, all of it. When they come into court, they are well-respected. They represent their clients AND themselves very well. Attorney Trinidad represented me very well. Honestly, they all treated me as if I was their daughter, & for that, I'm eternally grateful. My case is dismissed, & I am planning to expunge this case in a few years when the time comes, & best believe I'm gonna have Attorney Jed & Attorney Trinidad represent me. Thank you for giving me a second chance at life. Thank you for reminding me there's so much more to live for. Thank you for fighting for me, so I'm able to finish school & continue to build my future & be an inspiration for others. I'm eternally grateful!",

I was looking for an aggresive lawyer in court and knowledgeable. A lawyer that would help us reach our goal of a dismissal. I quickly texted Marni and within 2 days we had an appointment to meet.\n\nIn the few moments after meeting her I felt such a sense of relief. Marni Jo was knowledgable, very friendly and down to earth.I knew she was going be a great representation for my case.\n\nMy case lasted 1year and 6 months. We had a few challenges and set backs and restarts as cases were moved to different courts, prosecutors and DA\u2019s changes. The COVID hit and all closed down. But Marni continue to work from home on behalf of my son. Marni always kept me informed and assured me we got this.\n\nMarni Jo is very good at requesting things that are needed from you. I recommend you to follow her guidance.  If you stay on top of things this keeps her on top of her defense tactics for you.\n\nI just got news that today the case was dismissed and it can be expunged. Marni Jo has been an Angel sent to me. I will be eternally grateful for Marni Jo. Shes is there for the people, she cares and is compassionate and a Beast of a Lawyer who will get you results. Hire Marni you wont be disappointed.\n\nJosie",

It seemed like he already had a plan before ending our conversation. He's put me in position to succeed and eventually have my case expunged. Having either met (Adrian, Jennifer,  Carly,  and Ainsley) or communicated via phone,  text, email, the entire TPL Staff  is nothing short of AWESOME! There's only one Attorney I'll be recommending, TREY PORTER!!!",

My favorite thing about working with Law Offices of Anna R. Yum was the follow up and the genuine concern for my case was above and beyond what i would expect from an attorney. The outcome of this case was that i was able to get an expungement that now enables me to obtain the required licenses to grow my business and my income. Thanks to this outcome, this outcome has changed the course of my career and income potential.",

From the very beginning, Mark took the time to thoroughly understand my situation and provided clear, concise guidance at every step. I was definitely a difficult client at times in terms of being very overwhelmed and emotional in some parts, but Mark and his team were very assuring that they were working behind the scenes and it showed in the end.\n\nOn October 22nd, I was charged with a felony hit-and-run and arrested\u2014my future and everything I had worked for felt like it was at stake. Mark was not only exceptional at communicating but also went to bat for me while expertly balancing the needs of his other clients. Fast forward to today, we achieved the best possible outcome: no jail time, no fines, dropped to a misdemeanor with a possible expungement as early as December next year, and only summary probation.\n\nMark is not only a phenomenal attorney but also an even better human being who genuinely cares about his community and the good people of San Diego County. His dedication, compassion, and professionalism set him apart. I can now be at peace in knowing our investment payed off. What a great late birthday gift and graduation present this was, Mark, my family and I are so grateful for you. I will always recommend Mark and his team to anyone in need because their services, communication, and overall approach are truly second to none! God is good.. all the time. Thank you Mark and everyone who is apart of this wonderful firm.\nChristian",

          "text": "When I first found mark it was from all the 5 star reviews and at first I thought it was too good to be true. I was facing a DUI case back in 2019 and I wasn\u2019t sure what to do. He assured me that I only put down a small payment and if the case goes to court I will pay the rest of his fees which were already affordable in comparison. To make a long story short my case ended up with a complete Acquittal and I don\u2019t believe he even charged me his original fee of 600$. I was in disbelief of the good news and from there on out I knew he would be the only defense attorney I would use. This review is for my felony I received back in 2012. I had completed 3 years of probation as well as time served and community service (I took a plea bargain) for felony evading. When court finally came around back in 2021 Mark went up to bat for me as the prosecutor did not want to expunge my case. To make a long story short he got not only my felony reduced to a misdemeanor but also my record wiped clean!!! This man is a man of the people and anyone would be lucky to have them In their corner. Hands down best defense layer in the city of San Diego !!!! Thank you again Mark, sorry for late review \u2026\nBest of luck\n- Nick",

He is honest and helps you sometimes look at things in a different perspective, which is not always something you may want to hear but it helps you get the big picture if need be. Peter helped my sons father go from getting 10 years minimum prison time down to barley 2 years. Not only was he there for us while my husband at the time was dealing with court, but he was also there for us while he served time all across the country. Literally, in 5 different states. Peter was there for us every step of the way which gave us sense of security, knowledge, understanding and peace. I was pregnant with our son at the time so this was extremely important and helpful. I don\u2019t know how many times I contacted Peter and he answered all the questions I had without me feeling like an inconvenience. Not only is Peter one of the best lawyers in San Diego but he\u2019s also a family man so he truly understands how important family is and keeping them together, which i believe is one of the qualities that makes him the great lawyer that he is. Peter also has great resources, unfortunately during my husbands first case his work wrongfully terminated him. Peter pointed us in the right direction and got us in contact with a lawyer that won our case. To top it off, Never did I think that I\u2019d need a lawyer for myself but when I did, Peter was there for me too. He got my felony completely dropped which saved my clean record. Another quality I really liked about Peter is that he gets back to you no matter what time you contact him. Weekends, Holidays and after office hours, there\u2019s no such thing as 9-5 because whenever you need him, he is there. Peter also owns up to misunderstandings, even if they\u2019re your fault. I misunderstood that for my B&R I needed to bring my court paperwork. Since I showed up without it I couldn\u2019t do the B&R which meant I was a \u201cno show\u201c and could get jail time, but Peter didn\u2019t let that happen. He told the judge it was his fault, misunderstanding that I \u201cmissed\u201d the B&R and because of this the judge gave me two more months to have it completed. I could go on and on about our 3+ years experience with Peter, how great it was and how thankful we are but know this. Picking Peter to handle your case(s) and represent you, a family member or a friend, is something you will not regret, but be thankful for. He is truly a blessing. Thank you Peter for everything you have done, not only for myself but for my family too.",

          "text": "If you are reading this, you have found the right attorney! I was in the most distressed time of my life. I did not know where to start. My brother hired one of the best criminal attorneys in Memphis,TN. I called him and explained my situation and I asked if he knew or had colleagues in San Diego,CA. He said, no but I would advise you go on the Avvo website to start. Also, he said; you do not want a lawyer that has been doing this too long or right out of law school. I thanked him and he said good luck! I then, went to the Avvo website and after scrolling through. I read Peter Blaire\u2019s background, yrs of experience, and the statement \u201c  Our primary goal is to fight aggressively on your behalf to ensure you move beyond your case towards a successful future and a clean record\u201d grabbed my attention. I knew the uphill battle I was facing.  I called Peter Blaire immediately and gave a summary of my situation.  Peter Blaire spoke with confidence, directness, and assertiveness. No sugar coating. I knew I found the right man for the job and he is not what I call \u201c a glory getter\u201d! I expressed to Mr. Blaire from the beginning; I have integrity and will be transparent with my situation.  After almost 1.5yrs with patience and resilience my false allegations of a misdemeanor and felony charges were dismissed! I took 2 DV classes and parenting. These classes are effective for victims and offenders. I also had to have someone monitor me with my son for 6 months on the family side to prove the truth! I could breathe again.  Peter Blaire\u2019s commitment and demeanor helped remind myself I was fighting for myself and 4yr old son. It fueled my determination and motivation to prove the truth of false allegations. Furthermore, I had to hire a family attorney. Despite what I have endured and continue in this process. Always trust your gut! A long story short. I was young and naive when I married a charismatic high ranking naval man who who claimed to be a victim and portrayed me as the offender.  I was trapped in a situation across the US away from my family. My case was not clear cut and was unique.  I hope this review helps someone in a similar situation. Peter Blaire is your wingman, his job is to defend and protect by having your back! Don\u2019t give up!\n\nDavid Goggins once said; \u201cLiving a life avoiding failure does only one thing for you: it never gives you the opportunity to see what you truly are capable of\u201d.",

He came to the county jail the day I contacted him and talked to me about my options. He even tried to give me some cash so I could bail out and have money for a bus home. The guard wouldn't allow it though.  Peter helped me get my charges reduced, get a good plea deal, and continues to help me with advice and action throughout my probation process. He's also going to go to court on my behalf in a year in order to expunge my record and have me taken off of probation. Peter is a great lawyer and I would recommend him to anyone facing charges and needing help.",

His knowledge of the written law with all of its obscure and subtle nuances is extraordinary and so vital to any defendant desperate to survive the criminal \"in-justice\" system. Had I not been fortunate enough to receive his prompt response to my call, I would very likely be living the rest of my life with reputation-crushing charges on my criminal history that I would never have been eligible to expunge or conceal. The effort he puts into sharing his wealth of knowledge on his website is a testament to not only the caliber of attorney he is, but also to the level of integrity he maintains as a fellow human being. Michael Lowe is the real deal and we are lucky to have him on our side! Thank you so much, Mr. Lowe! The system is so broken, but you give me hope. I promise you are making the difference that people are crying out for! I appreciate you and I'm not just saying that.",

First, Mr. Howard\u2019s philosophy as an attorney is treating his client as a human being.  During the free initial case evaluation telephone conference, Mr. Howard carefully listened to my case and tried to get to know me as a person.  After speaking with Mr. Howard during the initial evaluation conference, I knew I had found the best attorney I was looking for in Dallas.\n\nSecond, his quality of service is second to none.  My case was successfully dismissed after serving probation, and he is working on the expungement so that my background records stay clean.  Mr. Howard clearly explained his plan to dismiss my case from the beginning.  Mr. Howard and his office team members have a great communication process with a secure online portal, where you can ask questions, upload documentation, and upcoming court date notices, etc.\n\nI am so happy to find Mr. Howard, and my case has been dismissed.  I highly recommend reaching out to Mr. Howard if you need to talk to a lawyer, he will take time to listen and treat you with respect.",

When I hired him he told me he would dismiss both of my cases so we could expunge them in the future. But he lied. He had a rookie attorney represent me in court years ago and now only one of my cases can be expunged while the other case can still be seen by certain entities.\n\nAdditionally: Randall Isenberg said he would expunge and seal both of my cases for $1200. The lady Gloria called me yesterday (05/12/2022) and told me they would still honor $1200 for both cases. I walked in today to sign and the lady tells me they would charge me $1500. This felt like they spit in my face twice.\n\nThis firm has no word. I would STRONGLY advise to go with a better attorney.",

On top of the fact I was told when I payed that included helping me get this expunged from my record after all was said and done. This was a total lie and of course they wanted more money.

Despite the fact that I still had two weeks left to complete my probation, Nafiz's exceptional legal expertise and dedication to my case resulted in an outstanding outcome. He successfully achieved the early termination of my probation, allowing me to proceed with my expungement application without delay.\n\nNafiz's professionalism, knowledge, and unwavering commitment to my case were evident throughout the process. He meticulously prepared and presented my motion, addressing every detail with precision. His strategic approach and persuasive arguments were instrumental in the judge granting my motion.\n\nI am extremely grateful for Nafiz Ahmed's hard work and highly recommend him to anyone in need of a skilled and dedicated lawyer. His efforts have made a significant positive impact on my life, and I cannot thank him enough for the excellent outcome he achieved for me.

This firm helped me realize my paperwork was completed already. He went above and beyond for me. If you need a lawyer for anything , he is the one to call!",

He didn't charge me to go to court again to have my record cleared. Through his help, I am able to proudly have my case be known as an Expunged Misdemeanor. He is such a hard-working and persevering lawyer, and he did not rest until he fulfilled his guarantee. Thank you so much once again, Mr. Cvietkovich for giving me my life back.\n-VM",

You see I live in Texas now and needed him to handle an old arrest on my record from 1985 in San Jose. He listen to everything I wanted him to do with the old arrest on my record. Advised me on what I needed to do via email to him with payment and documents! He wasted no time! I'm very impressed with his professionalism and knowledge of the law! I will report that today I got the call from him stating the old arrest on my record has been expunged! Attorney Green got this done in less than 2 months! Wow! That's impressive! If you're looking for an attorney that gets things done this is your man! Hire him you won't be disappointed!",

It caused me issues with employment and later when I started my business, on who I could get work from, and needless to say it was embarrassing.\ni did quite a bit of research on what needed to be done, and then I contacted a half a dozen attorneys in Santa Clara county.  Right off the get-go several of the attorneys had no idea how to deal with this, so I randomly selected Holden, based on other positive reviews, to meet with first. That was in October 2020. We met in an outside cafe in down town San Jose \u2018because of Covid\u2019. He was VERY straight up about everything, he explained everything in detail, and all the steps, including the restoration of my 2nd amendment . rights, which is a separate step. He also made it very clear that the courts were a mess because of Covid, and I should be prepared for this going into Spring before I would get a court date. This is the only thing that Holden did not get correct; Holden called me on January 20th and told me that my felony was reduced to a misdemeanor and the misdemeanor has been expunged.  So spring came on January 20th 2021\nI found Holden to be very professional, and very thorough.   He returned my emails instantly as well as my phone calls. This has been a very rewording experience.  I am now 74 years old and this has been hanging over me for most of my life.  I just regret that I did not do this many years ago.",

I had a felony for GTA and it was a pain in the butt to get jobs and do other things without this over my head. I finally am a felony free man. he told me the time frame would take about 2-3 months and I was ok with that. mr green stood in communication every time I contacted him. never ignored my text or calls. he was able to get my felony reduced to a misdemeanor and then expunged from my record. it was very relieving to know I didn't even have to go to court. I live in Tracy. and the case was in Santa Clara county and I did this all by phone. worth the price. thanks mr green",

          "text": "There are no words I could possibly use to thank Mr.Green enough for his service. It all started when SJPD violated rights and lied about my charges. Long story short, I ended up with 3 felonies; Sales of Marijuana, transportation of marijuana, and Sales of Narcotics. I'm not a criminal nor a drug dealer, but SJPD made me out be a big time kingpin. At first, I didn't think I needed a lawyer, me being stubborn as I am, I thought everything would be dropped. Something inside me told me reach out to a lawyer and I consulted with 2-4 lawyers before hiring Mr.Green to help me out. All the other lawyers didn't want to hear much about my case uphand before a retainer was placed. I was searching on avvo one night and decided to give Mr.Green a call at 10PM... the night before Memorial Day, suprisingly enough, he answered! He said \"I forgot to turn my answering machine on and I never pick up calls this later... but Hi, I'm Holden Green and what can I help you with?\" At this point I was incredibly apologetic, however he insured me it was okay and he was ready to hear my story and give me his advice. After talking on the phone worh him for about 45 minutes, (mind you its about 10:45pm) he set up an appointment to meet with me on Memorial Day! The one day everyone else was off... Mr.Green was willing to talk to me. He was willing to work with my budget and was never ever rushing my payments with him. He even asked me if all the cash I handed him was everything I had, he was willing to give me some money back if I was dead broke!!! Who do you know that would do that? Mr.Green has a heart for his clinets and he cares. He knows what's he doing he moves so confidently in the court room. Each and everytime we went to court, Mr.Green knew almost everyone in the room and had small talk with everyone. He lifts up the spirit of the courtroom when he walks in. As a young person facing 3 felonies, he fought for my life. My life would be over if I was a convicted felon, but with the magic of Mr.Green.... he went beyond the call of duty to insure my freedom. He made sure I did everything I had to do to make it look good in the eyes lf the District Attorney and judge. After nearly a year of fighting for life, I ended up with 2 misdemeanors and one felony that's only on my record for a year. I will be calling Mr,Green next year for my expungment! From facing prison time to only 90 days of weekend work cut in half to 45 days? You really can't complain. Mr.Green is nothing but the best out there. Hopefully I never everytime have to use his services again, but I've recommended him to many of my peers. Mr.Green is the people's lawyer and he's not a greedy person. He's very nice and has always answered every single question I've had in a timely manner. If you're looking for lawyer, LOOK NO MORE. I promise you, this will be the best decision you've ever made in your life. You can never put a price on freedom and I'll forever be greatful for Mr.Green.\n\nThanks for everything Mr.Green!",

A field I had worked in for 16 years before I got into trouble) . Mr. Green explained to me process to achieve the positive outcome I was looking for.. Thanks to Mr. Green I am now off of probation and my record has been wiped clean so I can now get certified by the state and return to work in the field of work I love.

From there, Kevin had me come into his office to explain my side of the situation. He analyzed the evidence and was quick to determine the route we should take. The charge was reduced to obstruction of a highway, and one-year probation. I'm truly grateful for Kevin and plan on hiring him again when probation is over to have this case expunged and sealed.",

I don\u2019t live in Austin so the fact that he was able to handle everything without me ever having to step foot in court was a huge bonus. I highly recommend Kevin for anything needed in the Austin area! I plan on reaching back out to Kevin in a few months hopefully to get this case fully expunged.",

From the time I communicated with the firm, to having them on my case, I got constant updates weekly for months. Allyssa was so sweet and always sending me cute emojis and would get back to me in such a timely manner. Anytime I needed Matthew she would set it up, and he would contact me as promised. I never felt out of the loop and Matthew the day of my court date walked me through the expectations or what would happen and the best news it was dismissed. He even took time to walk me down to the clerks office to help expedite (as much as possible) receiving my bond payment back or at least starting the process. My DV case was a dark cloud and to be set free and the truth now gives me my light back and my new path forward. My next step with them is expungement and I know when that time comes, it will be handled properly, promptly and professionally. This firm truly was God or the universe sent to me! Thank you so much!",

He has a set of legal skills and social personality that allowed me to know and feel that not only was he working/fighting for me in every way that he could behind the scenes, but also that the situation was in the best legal hands that it could be in.\n\nIt was easy to tell that he genuinely cared and never hesitated to take action, in part because he even took the time to make a bit of a personal connection as a friend, off-topic, in between it all. David was able to work his powerful professional abilities even amidst the pandemic, and he managed to get a nonsense warrant eliminated just in the nick of time before I returned to the area from a year of working abroad ...and the case *dismissed* mere days thereafter!\n\nI can't recommend Mr. David D. White enough if you're looking around for an attorney. I confidently look forward to a successful expungement as well. Oh, and the value of the rate he charged just left me feeling that much extra grateful for having found him.\n\nThank you, David! Keep up the amazing work - you're a hero.",

When I first got arrested for the first time I really was lost and didn\u2019t know what to do. The bail bonds company reccomended me to look for an attorney in Travis county and I live in Houston, which made it a bit hard because I\u2019m not familiar with the area. I started searching, called a few attorneys in the area and honestly no one heard me out like David did. He was honest with me and very encouraging. I scheduled a consultation with David and I was instantly impressed with his professionalism and knowledge of the criminal process. He even came in to his office on a Saturday to sit and talk to me, which was his day off. I walked in super nervous, but as soon as we sat down and went over my case he gave me hope and was really honest about everything. I didn\u2019t even have to consult with another attorney after consulting with him. I Hired him right at the spot. As soon as I walked out of his office I felt he took a huge weight off my shoulder. I honestly can say I was speaking to god. Very supportive, friendly and his trust was everything to me. Not only will I see him as an attorney I see him as a friend. Very stressful process, but David was always calm and confident and that helped me a lot going through this. He was very communicative with me always. Thank god and him we finally were able to get the case dismissed, and my expectations were exceeded. For a first time in my life I went through this I\u2019m glad i met such a dedicated, talented, supportive and professional attorney like him. I really hope and pray I never go through this again and never need his services, but if someone in my family or friend needs an attorney I will highly recommend him. Now we\u2019re working together and hoping we can get the case expunged. With case dismissed he still answers my calls and helps me in anything I need. I highly and strongly recommend David White as your attorney.\n\nThank you so much David",

          "text": "Chris Perri is - in my opinion - the most talented habeas attorney in Texas.  While I recommend you hire Chris before your family or friend needs a habeas attorney - Chris Perri is who to go to if that person had an incompetent trial attorney or if new evidence has come to light.  For me as a Republican to think so highly of a former Democratic congressional candidate should say something.  Competence trumps politics.\n\nIt goes beyond saying looking for a habeas attorney is not the same as getting a traffic ticket attorney.  I recommend any family member or friend to review Mr. Perri\u2019s briefs in the Texas appellate courts.\n\nWin loss records are tough to glean in Texas since almost all won cases are expunged.  However, there is one really cool statistic that is true as of the date of my review.\n\nFor writs of habeas corpus (do a partial search of WR and then Perri at the CCA website), Chris has 6 pending cases out of a total of 18.  Most of the other habeas attorneys with notable Google presences as in the range of 1 or 2 pending cases out of like 50 total cases.\n\nFind me an attorney in Texas with a better publicly available writ percentage.  I don\u2019t think you can.  Furthermore, that percentage cannot include the won cases because of expungement law.\n\nFurthermore, I urge you to go in and look at even the cases Chris has lost.  We\u2019re talking writs of habeas corpus here - not getting a lawyer to sign you up for defensive driving.  Every single case that is challenged by local officials has an objection.  Furthermore, almost every single case has gotten at least an independent review by the CCA.  This does not happen with most lawyers much less those who go pro se.\n\nChris has a vetting process which is easier on the budget and fair.  Finances aside, this protects your loved one from having a poorly written writ actually filed and you then have no more realistic bites at the apple for your family member or friend.\n\nI have paid Chris for a charitable writ of habeas corpus case that is still pending (it is for the 1 client of Chris Perri\u2019s that is not in TDC) at a discounted rate.\n\n(In the anticipation of potential ultimate victory and expungement, I am not posting the case name in this review.  However, even if the final outcome is adverse, I know Chris put up the best fight of any attorney and I know his client has and will have all of Mr. Perri\u2019s briefs to deal with any potential future background issues while the case is pending or if God forbid there is an adverse outcome in a system designed not to allow writs to be considered easily.)",

I was facing 2 criminal charges in which one a felony and she was able to get both charges dropped. I was facing jail time/ probation. I thank God I had Mrs. Tori as my attorney! I did not have to appear for any court cases. I was able to work and be a mom to my two young boys while my attorney handled all the court cases. She kept me updated on everything and made the very challenging experience very pleasant. She of course did not make any promises for the outcome of my case, but the outcome was in my favor. I did not have any criminal record or even speeding tickets prior to these charges. It took about 6 months before the case was finally resolved. But it was worth the wait. If you are looking for a attorney who will fight for you, please hire Mrs. Tori! She was worth every dollar! Thanks to her I could continue with my life with a clean record. I can join the military since I was not convicted of a felony. I thank you again Mrs. Tori for your services on my case. You are simply amazing and the best attorney!",

However, we were completely unprepared when our young adult son was recently arrested for Boating Under the Influence.  Without hesitation I immediately placed a call to Epstein & Robbins.  I am well aware of the excellent reputation that David Robbins has in handling alcohol related offenses.  He personally returned my phone call within minutes.  Mr. Robbins was able to not only provide me the information I needed, but more importantly, he was able to give assurances to my wife that our son would be alright.  We hired him immediately and Mr. Robbins was able to quickly secure our son's release on bail.  Throughout the process he and his firm kept my wife and I updated on the legal process and was soon able to get the case completely dropped!  He is now working on getting our son's record expunged.  I cannot say enough positive things about this law firm and Mr. Robbins in particular.  If you or a loved one are facing an alcohol related offense, do yourself a favor and hired the best lawyer in the field.",

I was charged with a first degree felony for obstruction of Justice by port authorities who suspected me of being an arms dealer because they found in my trunk a rebuild kit for a lower unit to a 300 Blackout assault rifle. The reason I was even approached by these officers is I was taking pictures of a ship that was under investigation for transporting illegal arms overseas. I was unaware that you could not take pictures of any vessels while in the port and did not have any knowledge of this vessel being under port surveillance, but this did not matter to the arresting officers. I tried to explain to them that I was just a tourist, and was just trying to get some pictures of these huge cargo ships and Navel ships to share with friends and offered to delete any pictures that I had already taken but to no avail, these officers were convinced that I was involved with arms dealing. Even after I explained that I am a decorated vet and just visiting the port for the first time they insisted that I was lying to them. I spent two days in a holding cell before I was charged and told what bond I could pay for my release. As soon as I returned home I began to look for an attorney but I could not find a local attorney that could help me with such a case, especially one of this magnitude. So I had to look for law firm that was large enough to handle the case for me but still only cost me a fair price since I did not live anywhere near Port. After explaining my predicament to several law firms and getting projections of the cost for my defense I chose Musca Law. They were the only Law Firm that said that they could insure that I would not be charged for a Felony that would destroy my rights especially my rights to bare arms. Knowing that I lived out of town they even insured that I would not have to be present for the several court sessions that proceeded that actual trial date. Prior to that they first got my charges reduced to a Misdemeanor charge which I was very satisfied with but the Lawyers at Musca law were not satisfied with that because I would still have something on my record, when I went to court on November 20 2019, I expected to be charged with a Misdemeanor of Trespass but to my astonishment I walked out of the court room with no charges on my record at all. For a vet who prides the right to bare arms an having a clean record is a must if you want to own a weapon. Musca Law is one hell of a law firm and like I said I had an entire team of Lawyers working my case when I hired Musca Law and they made sure that my rights were protected so if your like me and find yourself in serious trouble just being in the wrong place at the wrong time and want a great Law firm for a very reasonable price Call Musca Law, they really listen to you and will fight for all your rights.",

Charged with Aggravated Assault with a deadly weapon and a convicted felon for 4 robberies in my past. Charges got reduced to misdemeanor criminal mischief. The attention and kindness I have been shown all through the process has been top notch. For every court appearance I had 3 representatives show up Letty, Christy, and Audrey. I got 3 for the price of 1. All top notch and beyond dedicated. Everything was explained to me at a level that was comprehensible. I have future plans to get records sealed so that I may still be able to get a decent job for my future. I believe my money was well spent and will refer anyone to this firm. Thank you Audrey, Christy, and Letty for your dedication, professionalism, and expertise!",

While i didn't get what i hoped for, im very happy and satisfied with the outcome on probation for just a year and a half, and have my records sealed after probation. Luftman will definitely be my first call if im ever in need of representation!! Thank you for the hard work and dedication yall did for me!",

Now I\u2019m able to get a job, I\u2019m no longer facing a felony on my record and when I\u2019m able,  Zach Olah said get ahold of him he is willing to help me get the remaining misdemeanors expunged so I can have a clean record. It felt like Mr.Olah and his team genuinely care and weren\u2019t just going to get this over with and be on their way but truly want to help the people understand the process and get the defense that is not half assed or anything like that. I appreciate the work he has put in. Truly made all the difference. They do what they do top tier. Great work and great people.",

A friend recommended Dustin Blake.  Dustin saw a way to get the case dismissed and that's exactly what happened. He is now working on expunging my record. Look- if you get in trouble with the law you want somebody who knows what the hell they are doing. Dustin will work in your best interest. He knows how to use the law to your advantage and keep things moving in a direction that protects you. Plus his fee was very reasonable.  If you find yourself in any kind of legal bind- protect your reputation and your future. Give Dustin a call, explain your situation and listen to what he has to say. You won't be disappointed.",

He took the time to listen to all circumstances around my charges before just quoting me a rate. Before he even decided to proceed with representing me he did research and ensured that he was confident that we could accomplish my goals for sealing my records. I greatly appreciate the time and effort and honesty provided by Michael. I would recommend his services to anyone seeking legal representation. Thanks for everything!",

This was the first time they were faced with any legalities and this office picked up an expungement/sealing case for them. They weren\u2019t even the original attorneys. First, they let them vent freely, then provided them with transparent legal advice, even assured them that it may be not necessary to even use them as the attorney since paper work was filed previously. However, the immediate trust within this attorney (Jason), transparency, and legal expertise this attorney provided moved them to use them anyway. The portal for messages, case updates, reminders, etc. were completely second to none; their portal is 21st century technology. Also, the compassion and customer service that Jason possessed exceeded expectations. As a client, my family member did not even have to go on the record for the case to be completed. Last, and of course certainly not least, the end result was favorable for my family member. Jason was able to get the desired results for my family member which was to get their record sealed. I rate this business 100 stars!!!!!!",

He represented my husband on a Domestic Violence case which he got completely dismissed and then even got the records sealed which was above and beyond what we had hoped for. He also represented me on a Civil Stalking Case and the end results of that proved to be outstanding. In addition to those cases, he has represented my husband for several years during a lengthy custody case. He has ALWAYS gotten us GREAT results. He has been very knowledgeable, fair priced, and very helpful. He proved to be extremely accomadating not only to our schedules but to our finances as well. We would happily recommend Mr. Burke to all those in need of legal services near his area.",

My lawyer solved my legal problem quickly and efficiently. I could not have hoped for a better result. First case he did for me all I had to do was look at my phone on my court date and a text popped up says case dismissed. And then woke up today to text that says congratulations. Offer is a misdemeanor. I couldn\u2019t believe it I was impressed because my case was a felony assault 4. Attorney Scranton has close down two cases in the spam time of 2 months. also my lawyer is in the process of expunging my other felony case I got sentenced for years ago as we speak. I highly recommend this law firm 100% it\u2019s worth what you paying for. Fair prices and very negotiable person. This is the best lawyer I have ever used highly recommend to anyone.\n\n\u200d",

He gave me a detailed assessment and delivered through and through (dismissal and automatic expungement). Anthony Delnero is a sigh of relief. I could not be more grateful for his service. Do hire him for your criminal defense needs!!",

Everything happened quickly - from the time we spoke on the phone, to the paperwork that was sent to me, and the filing. I\u2019m glad I found him! I will be recommending him to everyone.\nThanks, Jeff!",

In having very limited experience or knowledge of criminal attorneys or expungement lawyers, just the search to find an expungement lawyer who was knowledgeable and responsive were hurdles which because tedious. The Law Office of Jeff Cardella was literally the last office on a list of 10 criminal attorneys contacted (after hours), who responded via email and followed the initial email with a phone call, despite it being close to midnight and having no prior contact with me. Mr. Cardella was understanding and open, during a time when frustration, anxiety, and fear was more than a little bit increased and his calm and reassuring demeanor assisted in decreasing those emotions experienced. That initial experience with Mr. Cardella immediately assured me that he was the absolute right attorney to assist in addressing the issue(s) presented to him at the time which was also around the initial start of the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in courts closing down and then a backlog in the legal system. Nevertheless, Mr. Cardella remained thoroughly engaged and on top of things and resulted in successful completion of the legal issue presented. I am and remain very grateful for his assistance and the dedication to his clients in ensuring their best outcome(s).",

Kassi is very pleasant, professional, focused, driven, attentive to your concerns, reliable, available, explains in detail what's going on, answers and returns calls promptly and most of all she delivers. I just want to thank you Kassi Rigney for outcome of this case and i recommend her to everyone I know who needs her services\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udf8a",

He is able to make you feel at ease from the first time meeting each other. No matter how stressful the situation was he always had a calm demeanor. Jonah was consistent and punctual with his replies for my cousin's questions and concerns. He even threw in some jokes to lighten up the mood in during the court hearings. Make no mistake, Jonah takes action in the courtroom and fights for his client. He took care of my cousin and made sure she felt protected. Shared his knowledge and made sure she understood everything that was going on as the case proceeded. I am happy to say that his hard work and dedication to my cousin's case led to its eventual dismissal. I highly recommend him as a lawyer, he's your guy!",

Marc is a kind, genuine individual who truly wants to help people and he makes sure you're taken care of. His rates are very reasonable for the amount of work he does!

We found out recently that it was not when we tried to hire an expungement lawyer. The expungement lawyer told us he couldn\u2019t help because the case was on going. I googled lawyers who would able to help for his specific situation and came across Rebecca. She called me back within minutes. Before I even gave her a red cent she was already looking into the case and giving me advice on what she could do if I hired her. The second I sent her payment she was making phone calls. Within 24hrs she spoke to the clerk, probation officer, district attorney, the clerk again, the judge, and got the case dismissed. ALL WITHIN 24 HOURS. And while doing so, she still answered all my phone calls and text in a timely manner.  Looks like my first born child\u2019s name will be Rebecca. I can\u2019t thank her enough, I am eternally grateful.",

Even after years had passed since my husband's case, she reached out to us when a new bill was passed to get my record expunged. Without her, we would have never even known that was possible. Now his record is cleared and I can more openly apply for better paying jobs and he even got off parole early. This was such a blessing and Rebecca did not have to go out of her way to let me know that this was a possibility. This just proves that she thinks about and remembers her clients. It's proof that she cares about you and wants to do everything in her power to be sure that you are not defined by your offence. Would highly recommend her to anyone who needs a fearless advocate in their corner.",

          "text": "I always wanted to work in a career of public service, however the system led me to believe a small mistake in my youth would label me a criminal for the rest of my life. After thirteen years of being haunted by a record that didn\u2019t reflect who I have become, I found Stefanie\u2019s videos on YouTube. The things she said resonated with me. She explained how passionately she believes people like me should be able to move on with our lives, not shackled to the mistakes we made in our past. She inspired me to believe I was no longer a lost cause.\n\nGetting your record vacated sounds like a pipe dream to someone who had surrendered to a reality where my future was dictated by a lapse of judgement in my early 20\u2019s. Even if it was an option, I assumed expungement was something only available to folks wealthier and with better connections than I have. Let me say, I wish I had someone like Stefanie on my side a decade ago because she is hands down the best. It is obvious that she believes in the work she does and sees the best in people.\n\nStefanie took my call the very first time I reached out and reviewed my case free of charge on the spot. She gave me a play by play of every element of my record as it pertained to the criteria for having it vacated. She assured me of her experience and I left the conversation trusting her confidence in her work. Not only that, retaining her council was unbelievably affordable, even to me as a student working a part-time job. I knew Stefanie wasn\u2019t going to give me false hope for a paycheck like many lawyers might.\n\nStefanie made the process effortless for me. When she needed information, she provided easy instructions and online forms that saved me the hassle of navigating legal jargon and paperwork. Not only was my record vacated in a few short months, but the judge and prosecution sang our praises in court for the work we did. She is a joy to work with and the only person I would trust to my friends or family in Washington State looking to move on from a legal past that feels daunting and unforgiving.\n\nThank you so much to Stefanie and her dream team. Now I can focus on a life, family, and career I always wanted but never thought possible. \ud83e\udd72",

She methodically worked the case, did research, back and forth feedback with me, and eventually went before the judge. While the ruling was not in my favor I still consider it a successful outcome. Why? Stefanie's research brought her in contact with a number of administrators, responsible for managing the states monolithic data stores. She worked with them to correct numerous inaccuracies armed not with a court order, but rather, her interpersonal skills and charm. I was able to immediately confirm the changes as I already had a number of business screenings occurring. Overall, Stefanie, was thorough, diligent, and exuded a positive vibe, which at the time was important to me. I recommend her for all your lawyer challenges!",

I was in trouble out of state and had no idea what lawyer to chose for my case, after seeing a handful of other options he felt the most genuine like he was actually going to try for my case and made me feel very confident as long as I did my part with rehab he could lessen the offense. I just got off probation and now what could of been a felony or 2 years in jail is a closed case and able to be expunged. A bit more expensive then some of the other lawyers I met with, but he really made me feel like he was there for me through the whole process with checking up on me and following up on all the pretrial work. Also very good with returning calls within a day or few hours.\nThank you!",

I am a Maryland attorney who advised my nephew who had a dui issue in DC to hire scrofano law based on their reviews. I was also in contact with another attorney who said he would have to plead guilty and get on a program where he could have his record cleared. Her charge was $3500.\n\nChris Muttimer from Scrofano law told my nephew that he would not have to plead guilty and that they could get a non-prosecution and wanted $5000. My nephew was keen to go that route. AFTER the payment of $5000 there was a guilty plea and they did exactly what the other attorney had promised to do. In addition it was extremely difficult to get them to finish the submission of the paperwork after the program was over,\n\nMr Muttimer is no longer with the firm and I wrote to Mr. Scrofano explaining what happened and my concern because I advised my nephew to hire their firm. I asked him for a refund of $1500. He did not respond. I am hoping to file a complaint with the DC Bar regarding the unethical behavior on the part of the firm.",

I will be able to have my arrest record sealed. The results on my case are not typical and practically unheard of on a felony drug charge. My experience working with Ms. Patel was professional and educational as she explained the complex criminal justice system. As a criminal defense lawyer in DC, she constantly stayed in contact with me answering any questions or concerns that I had with my case. Her sharp work and professionalism is 10/10. I highly recommend her if you or your loved ones have any criminal issues in the District of Columbia, you\u2019ll be in great hands.",

When I received a court citation (speeding-related), I went through a process of interviewing different attorneys to determine which one I wanted representing me. When I held my initial conversation with Christopher and presented the facts to him, he was very confident (but approachable) and provided me with a high-level strategy for how he could get my case dismissed. He did this even before I made my decision to move forward with him and before I paid him money, which I appreciated. When I decided to move forward with him, he elaborated on that strategy. As a result of his expertise, sincerity, and thoroughness, I'm happy to say the judge dismissed my case! I also saw him represent another client; I saw that he consistently applies his legal expertise and strategic approach to attempt to ensure favorable outcomes for his client. I'd highly recommend him!",

After talking with Christopher he reassured me that if we requested a trial we could get a better deal than a suspended jail term.\n\nUp until the day of my hearing I was unsure due to the fact that the state said they would enhance my changes if I requested a trial.  The morning of Christopher invited me to the office to watch my body cam footage with him so he could once again reassure me.  After this meeting I decided to put it all in Christopher\u2019s hands and we requested a trial.\n\nTwo months before my trial, the prosecutors office decided to accept a deferred sentence and I entered the deferred sentencing process.  One year later my case was dismissed and I didn\u2019t even have to return to DC or stand in front of a judge.\n\nFrom the beginning it was obvious that Christopher was well known within the court house and as a result I felt so much more comfortable.  From having my hearing first on the docket to negotiating with the prosecutors with a simple in person conversation or email.\n\nI highly recommend Christopher to everyone, especially those who wish to maintain a clean record.",

Mark is a phenomenal attorney and has been tremendously helpful and prompt throughout the entire process. I called him last year with so much anxiety and worry about a charge that he was certain would get dismissed and advised me that once it happened, to call him back and he would work on getting my record expunged. Sure enough, the charge was dismissed and I reached back out to him this year and he got right to work on my case! Thanks to him, my record has now been CLEARED! The process was seamless and turnaround time was about 2 1/2 months which was sooner than I had expected. I am soooo grateful and blessed to have stumbled across their firm online! Please, if you have any issues regarding criminal matters , The Rollins and Chan Law Firm has you covered. I 10/10 highly recommend!!",

There were no issues and clear communication about what to expect, and the chances of success were concise. I communicated with Michael personally for the past 5 years about my case before I saved up the money and decided to go forward.

This need was not for myself, I desperately needed someone to represent my 45 year old son who has lost his way because of drug addiction.  He was facing two felony charges, both of which were very,  serious, with a maximum of 20 years on one and a maximum of 5 years on the other plus thousands of dollars in fines. The only experience I had ever had with the courts was divorce court 43 years  ago. My son had only traffic offenses. Neither of us knew anything about the court system or where to begin, much less what to expect. I contacted Adam Banner's office after researching attorneys online and he called me back within a short period of time. I made an appointment for us to meet with him, we met with Adam and he explained in great detail what to expect and a list of things my son could do to help himself. I hired Adam to represent my son that day! My son made matters worse by being arrested 2 more times on misdemeanors. Instead of helping himself as Adam had suggested, he dug himself a deeper hole. Adam worked very hard to get my son the best outcome we could hope for. Because of Adam Banner, my son was just given an opportunity to turn his life around and come out of this with no felony conviction and no jail time, with a chance to have his record expunged. The rest is up to my son!  Adam Banner did everything humanly possible to help my son, he was always professional, available to answer any question we had, as well as lead us through every appearance and kept us updated as to what kind of deal he was  attempting to pursue. I will be forever grateful to Adam Banner and would highly recommend him to anyone who needs a criminal defense attorney. Adam is not only an  outstanding attorney, but also a very compassionate person. You can't go wrong with Adam Banner!",

I have gotten into some trouble when I first turned 18 and it pretty much put a damper on my future. It held me back from reaching my full potential where I had to change my college courses, drop out and it affected my potential jobs and career choices. I started to feel like there wasn't any hope and developed a lot of trauma from it and decided to not face it. Fast forward many, many years later, my fiance knew how much this has put a burden me.\n\nI have talked about going back to school and seeking a certain profession. He surprised me by finding Adam and we instantly knew he was the guy for us. Mind you, we no longer live in Oklahoma and they made it such a breeze and kept me feeling comfortable and confident. Long story short guys, a couple days ago, it was finalized and my silly record was expunged and sealed! I cried when I received the great news and honestly looking forward to my future.\n\nSo thankful for Adam and his team! They truly saved my life. I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for an expungement or pardon!  I have a new lease on life!\n\nMy many thanks to Adam and Nichole and the rest of the team!",

This was the only fault I have ever had and yet the DA tried to give me 2 years probation along with community service with zero proof from them that I even did what they claimed! My case was brought down to only 1 yr probation, very minimal court fees and zero community service with a no contest plea. I wanted to plea not guilty, but I refuse to allow a jury to decide my future and face possible jail time over a misdemeanor, so this was the best choice for me. She went over every single option line by line, she made sure I was FULLY aware of what I was signing and agreeing to. Once my probation is done, all of this will be expunged from my name as if nothing ever happened to begin with! I, above and beyond, recommend Fassio Law to represent you! Every representative that works there has ALWAYS been supportive, professional and if who you're looking for isn't available, whoever answers the call will do what they can to take a minute to look at your case and answer your questions! They ALL make you feel like you are their priority and it absolutely shows! I will forever refer them to anyone in need!",

He was very receptive and understanding of the situation when I first contacted him for a consultation about my case. He got straight to work after our discussion to represent and gathered all the information I needed to know promptly which made the process simple for myself. Anytime I had questions, he communicated greatly and clarified when I confused with certain aspects of my case. After it was all said and done, he got my case dismissed and expunged! I'm really grateful for the help and support I received from their law form and would highly recommend him for anyone dealing with cases in OKC!",

I had tried to obtain a pardon a couple of times on my own, but was denied even though I had no further legal issues.  It became apparent that I needed an expert in navigating the legal system.  After doing some research I decided to contact Tommy Adler of Adler, Markoff & Associates based on the reviews his clients had given him.  Mr. Adler & his entire staff were professional & very kind.  They made me feel that my case was important & that I could trust them to do everything within their power to see that I received a pardon.  My case recently went before the Pardon & Parole Board, & I was granted a pardon.  I don't believe I would have been granted this pardon without being represented by Mr. Adler.  As soon as possible I will use the Adler Law Firm to seek expungement of my records.  I highly recommend Tommy Adler & staff for your legal needs",

Dustin was able to get my case dismissed before it even made it to a preliminary hearing and is in the process of getting my record expunged. His knowledge of the system and his dedication to fight for his client makes him the best attorney to have on your side. I had never had the need for an attorney before so naturally, I was a bit nervous about the whole process. Dustin was very reassuring and helped me to be at ease while he went to bat for me. I hope to never need a defense attorney again but if i do, I have no doubt that Dustin will be my first call.

Since I live in NC and located this firm through Google, it was blind luck that I found an attorney who did what he said he would do.  When I called his office initially, Tabitha was both knowledgeable and friendly but not pushy.  She suggested that I would want to talk with Phillip prior to signing a contract, which was exactly what I wanted.  Tabitha scheduled a telephone appointment where Phillip explained what he though he would be able to do and his expected time frame. My niece had received a driving without a license in TN following having her NC license revoked for DUI.  When she became eligible to get her NC license reinstated, the outstanding TN violation showed up and put the reinstatement of  her NC  license at a standstill.  The week after I signed the contract Nashville was hit with a devastating\ntornado, including extensive damage to Phillip's office/building.  Shortly after the tornado, COVID-19 hit. Nonetheless, Tabitha kept me informed every step of the way and encouraged me to call if I had questions.  Tabitha telephoned today telling me mission accomplished!  I am so happy that I chose Phillip and would highly recommend him and would use him again.\nI especially liked that I was not expected to sign a contract before talking to Phillip.  I  liked that there was open communication. I felt my business was not taken for granted.  Appreciation was expressed to me on several occasions.  Phillip is honest and his fee was reasonable.",

Nash just out of the blue. I truly wish I could pick lottery tickets as good as finding good attorney. I spoke with the paralegal and within an hour mr. Nash called me personally to discuss my case my case was old it was not in the clerk's office are in the computers so they had to dig for it the next day is paralegal called me and told me what was going on this was a Friday. The next week mr. Nash called me again personally to tell me my options he was going to try and expunged mycase so I didn't have to pay the fines and save me money. After further discussion he said that I wasn't a good candidate for expungement but told me after the time he had spent that I didn't need him or any attorney all I had to do was pay the fines at the clerk's office. I paid an attorney in my hometown $10,000 and spoke to him once mr. Nash spoke to me twice personally and his paralegal twice and then told me did I didn't need to pay him and told me how to take care of it myself so if you are looking for an attorney that will work for you and be honest with you do yourself a favor and hire mr. Nash. I sure you this is not a paid advertisements and completely honest I don't even live in the state",

I was very nervous in the days leading up to court, but once there Brian made sure that i knew everything that was going on, and did an excellent job negotiating to keep me out of jail and able to head back home as well. i will definitely be contacting them again when it comes time for my case to be expunged, thanks again guys!",

He was even willing to roll up his sleeves and stick it to them, if necessary, but it was over before it got there. It was a relief to have him in my corner during a tumultuous and stressful time in my life. He treats you with respect, doesn't judge you, and always tries to understand you and where you're coming from no matter how messed up it may be. Working with Mr. Pugh resulted in the claim against me being dismissed and he even went as far as to tell me he would get it expunged for me. Peace of mind is worth everything and that's the type of representation you get here!",

My search for a reputable attorney on Google led me to Andrew Beasley. He was able to get the ticket dismissed entirely and I was able to keep my clean record intact and not take a hit on my insurance! I couldn\u2019t be more happy with the results!!!",

From the very start, James was incredibly supportive, guiding me through every step of the legal process. He was professional, responsive, and thorough, ensuring that I was well-informed and comfortable with each decision. Most impressively, he was able to get my case dismissed and my record expunged, all without me having to appear in court. His expertise and dedication truly made a stressful situation manageable, and I highly recommend him to anyone in need of exceptional legal representation.",

Also, when my time expired to expunge my record, I received a ticket for failing to obey the traffic signal. The Law Office of Joel M. Mann and Maria Brustien did their best with their knowledge to help me receive a positive outcome and expunge my record. They reassured me my criminal record might not be expunged within two years, but they would continue to work to exceed the positive outcome. If you are reading this, hire them, and don\u2019t let your family bring you down. The Law Office of Joel M. Mann is the only way to go with a positive outcome to ring in the new year, THANK YOU <3!",

This last November I was visiting Las Vegas, and got myself into a pickle. I am from California and we were just visiting for two nights. Ended up getting in a heated fight with my boyfriend at our hotel, And ended up being me that was arrested because he had a scratch on his face, which was actually an old scratch from our new puppy. Needless to say, the cops did not believe him or I and I was led away in handcuffs. Spent the night in jail instead of celebrating my daughter\u2019s 21st birthday. I was arrested for battery. I thought My life was over. I just started nursing school. I googled best lawyers in Las Vegas, and this firm came up. Best decision I ever made hands-down. I did not even have to show up in person for my court appearance Augustus showed up on my behalf. All charges were dropped.. I thought thought I would be fighting this for years.. They even let me make payments! Super fair price, and if I ever get myself in another pickle, I will definitely be reaching out to Augustus Claus! No offense to him, but I hope that I never have to speak with them again ha ha.. if you find yourself in trouble, do yourself a favor and don\u2019t shop around. Immediately contact this company, and you will never regret it! The staff at the office was so friendly and best of all. They believed me when I explained what happened. I thought I would have to prove my case but one simple phone call changed my life forever. Thank you, Augustus and office staff! You are truly my heroes, and I will never forget what you\u2019ve done for me. I will actually be using this firm to have my record sealed or expunged because they told me, even though the charges were dropped, if a company wants to look super hard into my background, they will be able to find that I was arrested, even though it was dismissed\u2026 And they said I could even make payments on that! I\u2019ll end my paragraph here, but please do yourself a favor and contact this company if you are in trouble.",

He fought for me while I was out of state all the way up to my initial hearing back in town. He was able to prove that my ticket was unjustifiable and had the charges dropped.

Despite the incident occurring over a weekend, Mark didn't even hesitate to offer guidance and his expert opinion to swiftly get this legal burden handled. During such a stressful time, the last thing you want to worry about is if your legal counsel is capable of handling your case. There has never been a single moment where I doubted Mark or his team. Mark makes sure you are kept in the loop with every detail of your case by giving status updates, scheduling in person meetings and is always prepared for court. The McDaniel Law Firm is the best. Don't settle for anything less when it comes to your legal matters.",

He also has great relationships with other lawyers as well as those working in the courthouse.  Ken's staff was top-notch and very helpful.  To top things off, once the case was dropped at my pretrial hearing, Ken got my record expunged at no further cost to me!  I could not more highly recommend Ken Brashier!",

With Mr. Mudd as my attorney, I did not have to go to court 1 time. This completely took a giant burden of my shoulders. He did everything he said he would, he kept me informed of everything that was happening and in the end my record was expunged and I have Mr. Mudd to thank for that.  On a side note,  his prices are extremely reasonable for the services he provides.  God forbid I should have need of his services again.... but, if I do,  the first and ONLY words out of my mouth will be \"I need to speak to my lawyer Nick Mudd\".",

Well, search no more because Neil is your guy. From my very first phone call to his office I knew I had found the right person for the job. His secretary was kind and gracious while taking my information and assured me Neil would be in touch after court. True to her word, Neil called me that same afternoon. He asked me a few questions over the phone and had my history and information pulled up within minutes. From there he took the wheel, giving me step by step instructions on how he was going to help me through this process. He was in constant communication with me throughout the entire process and honestly just took all of my anxiety and worry away. Today marks the end of our journey to have my record expunged and the beginning of the rest of my life. Truthfully I'm a tiny bit sad that it's over. Neil is a great attorney and human and you should consider yourself lucky to have found him on Google today.",

          "text": "I was referred to Ahmad & Nolan Defense firm for my criminal case through word of mouth, which attests to their stellar character and reputation. When I first met Aneeq, his experience and calm demeanor really encouraged and helped me feel that I could trust him, which is crucial when it comes to attorney-client relationships.\nI have wanted to become a doctor for years, and I was facing a very serious felony that held a very high maximum sentence of prison time as well as permanently ruining my dreams of attending medical school. I shared my goals of becoming a doctor with Aneeq, and he assured me he would do everything in his power to make sure this was possible.\nInitially there was one serious felony charge, and the person pressing charges had purposefully falsified police reports, making it a very difficult case to fight. Aneeq worked very hard and spent hundreds of hours, bringing on multiple experts and private investigators to expose the lies this person had told, in order to defend me. Aneeq\u2019s connections were very important in the success of my case, and having the extensive network and resources on hand speaks to Aneeq\u2019s professionalism and skill.\nEarly on Aneeq noticed a crucial detail in my case that many other attorneys would have missed, and this led to many different facts of the case being discovered that really helped me. Additionally, recognizing this detail led to a witness coming forward and testifying on my behalf. Aneeq filed multiple motions throughout the case, many of them being pages long, and this gave us the opportunity to continue fighting the case. These motions that he filed were extremely meticulous and technical. Aneeq is one of the most detail-oriented people I have ever met, and he wrote these motions with precision and accuracy., giving us the best chance of success\nAneeq advised me not to take the plea\u2019s that the prosecution offered, and advised me when to take the plea. His risk-assessment and analysis of a case's strengths and weaknesses is phenomenal, and this allowed me to secure an amazing result in this case. Aneeq and his team got the prosecutor to admit this case was a probation case, not a prison case, and to lower this serious felony to the lowest possible felony available. In sentencing, they got me ZERO jail time and expungement of all charges. This result will allow me to continue on my path towards medical school. I could not be happier with the results, and more impressed with Aneeq Ahmad, Michael Fuentes, another lawyer at his firm, and the rest of Aneeq\u2019s team. I will recommend Aneeq to anyone I know who needs an attorney's services. Thank you all!!!",

No one is perfect but everyone deserves a chance to grow and do better. Ahmad emphasized that and fought so that my family could do just that- grow and do better. Fortunately, he was able to get all of the cases expunged and we are forever grateful. Thank you again! Choose Ahmad & Associates for an attorney who cares.",

I was represented in Harford County, one of the most difficult counties in MD to litigate. With the hearing taking place less than 4 weeks later, I was dismissed of charges and off to celebrate our victory within 30 minutes of the start of my hearing!\n\nTo top things off, my record was also expunged! Required documents were sent electronically almost immediately after the conclusion of the hearing for me to sign and return and filed the next day, on my behalf.\n\nI hope to never have to seek counsel in the future, but would highly recommend without hesitation, Attorney Kadish & Associates to my family & friends!",

I could tell by the professionalism and mannerism of him and his team that these people were the real deal and they knew what they were talking about. Not only was Mr.Kadish able to initially reduce a felony charge, but he was also able to get all of the charges I faced completely expunged from my record.\n\nTo Mr.Kadish and his team,\nThank you for everything!",

His services are worth every penny and more. His approach not only brings peace of mind but ensures results by going above and beyond. As for what he did for me: no jail time, no conviction, and a clean record. If I would have chose a cheaper route or done it on my own, You probably wouldn't be reading this.

He\u2019s extremely knowledgeable and a great guy in general. He had all my three charges / citations dropped, dismissed and all expunged!!! The traffic incident happened last year(2020) thanksgiving but due to the Covid 19 pandemic, all court cases were delayed and postponed. Mr. Okin updated me frequently about the case and what we needed  to do before the court date. On the day of the court date, ( September 2021, I was very nervous) but we  spent less than 15mins in front of the trail Judge. Mr. Okin presented my case and went back and forth with the State prosecutor and before you know it, the Judge stated he agreed with Mr. Okin\u2026and all  charges and fines were dropped and dismissed. I sincerely hope and pray  I don\u2019t ever need to retain Mr. Okin for anything ever again but if anything  ever happens or to anyone I know, he\u2019s definitely my go to person FOREVER!!\n\nPlease, if you\u2019re reading this post and you\u2019re looking for a lawyer to represent you in the court of law, pleaseeee reach out to Seth Okin before anyone else at least and tell him your situation regarding your charges \u2026I\u2019m extremely delighted to call him my attorney and a freind.",

Seth handled my case with poise and assurance from the moment we met over the phone through to my Case\u2019s dismissal and expungement.

While many attorneys use their practice solely for their financial gain, his unwavering efforts to ensure my expungement success throughout the entire process was remarkable. I was a layperson regarding this legality, but he took the necessary time, and had the patience to ensure my understanding, for which I am grateful and tremendously satisfied. Therefore, I highly recommend Jonathan on expungement cases because after all, he serves his clients by placing their legal matters as his first priority, secondary to a minimum financial gain which is what every client hopes to achieve from their attorney.\n\nPlease consider this as a sincere post.",

Mr. Peake and his team are the BEST.\n\nAt the age of 20- back in 2009- I was arrested in Valencia County. The record of my arrest, although I was not conscious of it at the time, dramatically impacted my self-esteem. I self-destructed over the next couple of years until I decided to make a change.\n\nAfter years of hard work and now a senior at UNM, I knew I needed to confront my past and get my record expunged in order to move forward into graduate school and become the woman I was born to be. The process was too difficult to confront alone ( I tried), so I contacted Mr. Peake and his brilliant team after being referred by UNM legal students.\n\nMr.Peake and his team took care of my case for next to nothing and I could not be more appreciative for their time and professionalism. They literally took care of everything while I continued to live my very busy life as a mother and student.\n\nThey truly wiped away the stain that once stood in the way of me and my dreams of one day becoming a mental health professional within the state I was born and raised, New Mexico.

Mr. Mitchell went above and beyond... even though he knew this wasn't a couple ordinary cases due to the psycho individuals they are, he took our cases on immediately and stepped up to the plate and started batting for us. He's no BS, doesn't lie to you just to get your business, and even gave us advise on the process of what to expect from the DA's office on another case with my ex wife being prosecuted on harassment charges. As a formal District Attorney, he knows the criminal laws in New Mexico.\n\nI can't thank Mitchell Law Office enough for all the hard work Aaron Mitchell and his paralegals put in before during and after the matter. Very attentive, professional, reliable, and you can really feel how passionate he is for you and your case. I've had an attorney in the past that I wondered if she was really advocating for me or my ex, not Mitchell though! If I called he would answer and did everything it took to achieve the desired result for my legal situation. From initial consultations to proceedings and then follow ups with reminders to submit my evidence and talk about the different outcomes that could take place, he was really on top of everything. I would highly recommend Mitchell Law Office to anyone needing legal representation for all your criminal representation needs, whether your the victim or perpetrated criminal.\n\nHe will be getting a highly sought-after review from me to the BARS Association of New Mexico! If I could give 10 stars, i would...Thank you again!!!!\n\nContact Mitchell Law Office- Attorney at Law for any criminal case you have in Albuquerque,  New Mexico or surrounding areas:\n\nCriminal Justice Attorney\nCivil litigation\nDUIs & reckless driving defense litigation\nDomestic violence litigation\nDrug possession defense litigation\nFelony defense litigation\nGeneral criminal defense litigation\nPetty crimes & misdemeanor defense litigation\nRestraining order litigation\nSex offensedefense\nA Criminal Case\nAggressive Dui Lawyers\nAssault Against\nAssault And Domestic Violence\nAssault Charges\nCharges Attorneys\nChild Sexual Abuse\nCity Criminal Defense\nCriminal Arrest\nCriminal Cases\nCriminal Charges\nCriminal Conviction\nCriminal Defense Attorney\nCriminal Defense Attorneys\nCriminal Defense Law\nCriminal Defense Lawyer\nCriminal History\nCriminal Investigations\nCriminal Law Dui\nCriminal Lawyer\nCriminal Offense\nCriminal Penalties\nCriminal Record Expungement\nDUI, drug charges, sex charges, protective orders, assault, DV charges\nDomestic Violence Charge\nDomestic Violence Charges\nDomestic Violence Defense\nDrug Charges\nDrug Crime Lawyer\nDrug Crime Lawyers\nDrug Offense\nDrug-Related Offenses\nDui Arrests\nDui Charges\nDui Conviction\nDui Defense Attorney\nDui Defense Attorney In\nDui Drug\nDui Drug Charges\nDui Lawyer At\nDv Charges\nExpunged Cases\nExpungement Lawyer\nExpungement Process\nFelony Dui\nFirst-Time Dui\nImpaired Driving Charges\nLaw Attorneys\nMinor Charges\nMinor Crimes\nMisdemeanor Conviction\nRape Charges\nRecord Expungement Attorney\nSex Crime Charges\nSex Crime Lawyers\nSex Crimes Charges\nSex Crimes Defense Attorney\nSex Offense\nSex Offense Cases\nSexual Assault Attorney\nSexual Offenses\nTraffic Case\nTraffic Charge\nTraffic Offenses\nViolent Felony Conviction",

I must say, the communication and promptness to our case made it much easier to work with Sam than it is working with some of the other firms we have worked with locally!\nIf you're looking for an attorney to help with your criminal case, Sam is definitely the person to get you to the outcome you're looking for. He is very dedicated in his work and follows through with his word.\nThank you Sam for helping my dad take care of this record so that he can move forward with his citizenship application and our family can stay united.",

He\u2019s not scared to speak up for you.\n\nHe\u2019s such a good lawyer I hired him again to expunge another felony case I have.\n\nHands down he\u2019s the best attorney I\u2019ve hired. He communicates directly with you and let\u2019s you know what\u2019s going on and makes you feel comfortable.\n\nThis is the first review I\u2019ve ever done. When I hired this lawyer I looked at these reviews just like I did the last 4 different lawyers I\u2019ve hired. I didn\u2019t believe in the reviews but trust me when I say he\u2019s a great lawyer don\u2019t pass him up.\n\nThe last 4 lawyers I\u2019ve hired and worked with where garbage compared to Sam.  Lots of money and time waisted. Because they couldn\u2019t win a case that Sam won for me and he made it look so easy.\n\nPlease do your self a favor and hire this attorney to support your needs you won\u2019t be disappointed...\n\nThanks,\nRichard",

From consultation to court appearances they were very knowledgeable and explained everything to me so I could understand. They never missed a court date and go above and beyond to help me get things done. They helped me have 2 felonies dismissed and a sealed record. If you are looking for a good attorney and firm this is the place for you. I finally got my life back and a clean slate. Mr Troncoso believed in me from the start and I could never repay him for all he\u2019s done for me.",

I was first given Ryan's number it was after hours I figured I would leave a message but he answered he listened to my whole story an made me feel like everything would be ok. By that next day he was already gathering evidence. Unfortunately covid hit and my case kept getting pushed back but anytime I needed something he answered or if I sent a email it was answered with in a few minutes. Ryan joined with David at some point during my case. The first time I spoke with David he new everything about my case I didnt have to fill him in on anything. For the duration of my case David had my back every step of the way. I calling him everytime I had a question or confused about something an he always answered, I was never pushed off to office staff to take questions of play muddle man I always talked to David directly. If it wasn't for David an Ryan I dont know what would have happened.  Now that my case is over an no jail time when I was facing 12 years or more. Ryan an David have still been there for me when I have questions even though they are no longer my attorneys. Dont waste your time on other attorneys that you are just another number. Choose a lawyer that truly cares an will do anything an everything they can to fight for you. I am beyond grateful that I found them.\n\nUPDATE: it's been 3 years since my last review and have put everything in the past. I am back as a client. I went back to Ryan, David and his team because they are the only ones I can trust. I am working on having my past expunged/set aside. I know that they care about my case an what I have been through and how important this is to me. I am completely grateful for Stephanie who is always there to answer my questions and explain things to me. She has been there from the beginning along with Ryan and it's nice to have people that have supported me through this whole journey. I have seen some of the other reviews and it's saddens me that some people seem to have had a unpleasant experience. I can't speak on their situation I can only say that it's definitely not my experience. Like I said before I don't know where I would have ended up with out them.",

My case was expunged within a few weeks and during the whole process, she was communicating with me and updating me on everything that was going on. She truly cares about the people that she helps and will be very open and honest about everything that is going on. She also could have charged me way more but states that this was a type of case she handled all the time and would not overcharge me like the rest of the lawyers I had contacted. I am super glad that I chose her, she would always answer any questions, she didn't judge me and put my mind at ease whenever I was over worrying. She also always returned my calls and was honest. I wish I would have gotten her for my conviction case but glad I found her for the expungement. I HIGHLY recommend her.",

With a conservative DA's office refusing to recognize the absurdity of the situation and admit a mistake was made, choosing to side with the officers who clearly made a mistake, Byron patiently stuck with us  for well over a year working through the process and clear up this mess.  Even in the face of a judge, warning us during our day in court, \"these kinds of motions are rarely, as in almost never granted\", Byron got it done and we got our motion granted and record expunged.   I certainly have a more skeptical view of the police and DA's office after this, and  one thing we learned  for sure, don't roll over and let the system push you around.  Get a good attorney like Byron and fight for your rights and freedom.",

The ticket I received was also a super speeder. My job requires that I have a clean record. I hired Kevin and he was able to help me get a great outcome. No points, no reporting to my MVR, this helps SO much because I work and drive a company vehicle for an insurance company. Kevin made the process very easy and seamless. Out of FOUR lawyers that I contacted, Kevin was the only one who was responsive, he was up front about his pricing and steps that I would need to take going forward. Most lawyers are lazy but not Kevin. I would hire Kevin again if ever needed his services! Thanks for the hard work Kevin!",

We put all of our faith in Kevin.  Kevin was able to speak to the prosecutor about my case and made him understand what was happening in my life.  He was able to convince him that I have a lot of potential and that this should not define me nor hinder me in the future.  Not sure how Kevin did it, but he was able to get my DUI charge changed to a local ordinance violation that will not show up anywhere.  And, the charge will be forever sealed and expunged.  Kevin always made time for me and my family and was very good about getting back to us about questions on my case.  I am grateful for this result and for all Kevin did for me.",

Mr. Brinkley was very knowledgeable on the matter, and we met numerous times to listen to me and review over my case to fight the charges.\n\nHe pushed with the DA many times to get the best possible deal, probation with felony discharge, which I did not think was possible. He was able to keep the case from going to jury, and was able to get the DA to accept the deal. After completion, he was able to expunge all my charges including previous charges from years ago on an unrelated case.\n\nHighly recommend Mr. Brinkley, he took time to consult me on my case during the process of turning myself in, before I had taken him on as my lawyer. I think he went above and beyond what most lawyers would have done, which I am extremely thankful for",

In court he was always one step (maybe two) ahead of the prosecution, showed the deficiencies in the police methods and had the entire charge dismissed. Thereafter, he and Ms. Garrnett navigated the process for record expungement. I cannot thank Mr. Saad and Ms. Garrnett enough for their efforts and total professionalism in handling my case (plus Steven is one good Backgammon player that still owes me a match).",

I still to this day can't thank Caroline enough for all she does, communicating and filing petitions. This is why you hire the best, things we can't do without legal help. Help that doesn't just get paid and do the minimum, help that continues with the little items until you're satisfied! Just call the office, Caroline will take care of it!",

Shortly thereafter, I found myself tangled up in the law searching for a competent legal team to represent me in what little did I know at the time would be a grueling, painful process, and in many ways it still is as i reflect back to a year ago when I was initially arrested.\n\nBecause the process is so painful its all the more important that you selectively choose a good lawyer. I found Saad law with no recommendation or much research, and fortunately for me my acorns landed at the root of a solid legal team that is personal and treats you like a human being.\n\nI can truly say that with the assistance I have received from working with Steven and Caroline that I was not just a dollar to them. I have worked with them for a year now and have been with me every step of the way.  They are an open book, and at all times, whether its emails or phone calls or you just need someone to vent to about things, they are always their to make sure your questions are answered and your stress is put at bay.\n\nEveryone is looking for the best possible results when it comes to matters of the law. My DWI was not expunged because plain and simple I was guilty as charged BUT, they were there to make sure that I was given a lesser sentence so that it did not destroy my life going forward. They knew my dreams and ambitions as an adult college student piecing his life back together after this unfortunate event and they kept that at the forefront of their strategy to ensure that whatever I faced didn't destroy the future I had in store for me.\n\nThey get to know you, they care about who you are and what you wish to do with your life and they do everything they can in their power to ensure whether your guilty or not that the conviction your facing is not going to limit the potential you have in store for yourself.\n\nNot every case is won by erasing a DWI, but they can also be won in cases like mine where I was able to get a reduced sentence so that my future was not delayed in anyway. I owe my future to them and I could not feel more blessed or thank God enough that I accidentally found a great legal team to represent me.\n\nThank you very much!\n\nBryan\nRaleigh, NC.",

          "text": "Review for Attorney Marshall\n\nI cannot speak highly enough of Attorney Marshall's exceptional professionalism, competence, and legal expertise. From the moment we engaged his services, he exhibited a remarkable balance of confidence and humility that immediately put us at ease. His deep knowledge of the law and ability to navigate complex legal situations were evident throughout the process. The charges in question were serious, but Attorney Marshall approached the case with unwavering dedication and precision. His ability to clearly explain the situation, provide sound counsel, and outline the best course of action gave us confidence during an incredibly stressful time.\n\nAttorney Marshall's grace under pressure and fairness were equally impressive. He handled every aspect of the case with the utmost professionalism, ensuring all our concerns were addressed and that we felt supported at every stage. His skillful advocacy resulted in all charges being dismissed, a testament to his commitment to justice and his unparalleled legal acumen. Moreover, his services were economically fair, demonstrating that his priority lies in achieving the best outcome for his clients rather than personal gain.\n\nWhat sets Attorney Marshall apart is his commitment to seeing the process through from start to finish. He not only secured the dismissal of all charges but also guided us through the expungement process to ensure the records were completely cleared. His thorough and meticulous handling of the case from the initial charge to final expungement provided us with a fresh start and a profound sense of relief. Attorney Marshall is truly an exceptional lawyer who cares deeply about justice and his clients' well-being. I highly recommend his services without hesitation.",

Ended up with a much lesser charge and just had to cover the costs. Plus, he's now working on expunging my case. And the best part? No hefty filing fee!\n\nChris made a complicated process feel like a walk in the park. If you're in a bind and need a lawyer, Chris Floyd's your guy.

          "text": "Jesse Scharff (and the Scharff Law Firm) is amazing beyond belief!\nTo summarize \u2013 here are reasons you should hire Jesse Scharff without delay:\n1.  Jesse and Reba communicate well. This also goes for all the personnel in his office. Jesse and the Scharff Law firm do their best to answer your questions within 24 hours and they keep you informed through the whole process.\n2. Jesse will not bullshit or sugarcoat you. He will be straightforward and let you know his thoughts and opinions about your case.\n3. Jesse knows the Judges, the DA\u2019s and all the people important in your case. He has the ability to spot weaknesses in the prosecution and the officers.\na. He will give you information to review \u2013 so you can review if you would like. In my case, I reviewed everything. I researched a ton and none of that mattered, because Jesse had it handled.\nb. Jesse will also give you the standard information for you to do prior to your court case.\nc.\tDo what he says.  I finished all the classes, pre-work and community service before my first court case in preparation for the worst scenario.\n\nHere are my reasons and why I say the above:\n\nI hired Jesse for a DWI charge.  He was a recommendation from a friend, whom in her case had a different attorney she fired, in order to hire Jesse.  The Sunday morning after my arrest on Saturday, I called Jesse\u2019s number, about an hour later, he called me and we spoke for about an hour.  In this initial conversation, I was impressed; not only by what he had to say, but also because of his demeanor and the steps he took to outline what I should do next.  Every time I met with Jesse, he was organized and on track.\n\nHere is where Jesse\u2019s experience and patience seals the deal.  When the DA was arguing my case, she went after everything, my demeanor, and my character and she presented a few incorrect facts and made broad and unclear assumptions.  Jesse leaned over to me and said, \u201cAll she is proving is that you were intoxicated\u201d and that\u2019s what she did.  After about an hour and thirty minutes, the DA only proved that I was intoxicated and could did not prove that I was driving or that I was complicit in any illegal activity.  Jesse got up and spoke for about three minutes to refute the evidence and said \u201cYour Honor, we have no evidence my client was in the car, and much less driving.\u201d\n\nMy case was dismissed and all charges dropped. My arrest and record were expunged and I have my life back.\n\nThe Scharff Law Firm is exactly what it is supposed to be. It\u2019s not super fancy, glamorous or in a pretentious high rise building.   It\u2019s perfect for an honest, hardworking firm. Jesse speaks to you as his friend & ally - always showing up to court to walk you through the process.\n\nJesse and the Scharff Law firm charge a fair and honest fee and the charge is worth every single penny!  Jesse sits down with you each time to give you instructions and his game plan.  Follow all of his (and his firms\u2019) instructions.\n\nI refer everyone to Jesse and would not hesitate to use him again.  I could not have asked for a better person to advocate on my behalf.  I trust Jesse and the Scharff law firm and I thank them for all their efforts.",

Jesse was patient with myself, my parents, and the court systems, and my charges were dismissed within 7 months. Within a year, the charges were expunged off my record. Jesse kept us fully informed during the whole process, and it was obvious that he is well-liked in the courtroom. He is truly wonderful and I am so thankful for all of his help to get me through such a tough situation. I highly recommend him, you will not be disappointed.",

Look no further than  Erase The Case, PLLC. headed by Mr. Weisselberger (spelled correctly on the first try) my experience with Erase the case was effortless. Mar,10,2022 I wanted to get my record expunged naturally google was the first to give me advice. When i called (i prefer tex, Millennial)  Mr. Weisselberger answered him self, i had assured myself i'd be speaking with his staff ( all wonderful people).  Mr. Weisselberger  and myself spoke of pricing which i couldn't believe there was an actual payment plan. Long story short i hired  Mr. Weisselberger to represent me to the State of Florida. He informed me of what's needed from me. Two days later Erase The Case had filed a petition on my behalf. We all Know how our Judicial system works here. Twelve weeks later, I received an Email from Dayana, an assistant at erase the case and she informed me that she's sending me a certified letter which states approval of my concealment. so if anyone needs to go thru this process give erase the case a call,  Mr. Weisselberger and his staff will care for you as if the know you personally. In the words of B.I.G himself, If ya don't know now ya know.....",

After retaining  Erase The Case, the process of sealing began, which only required a little patience and a few signatures on my end. Shortly afterwards, I was notified that my record was sealed successfully. This is where the additional star \ud83c\udf1f  above the rating comes into play. Even though my record was effectively sealed, a website had not removed my picture from the Google Search Engine. I contacted Erase The Case , and was immediately put at ease because I was told that it would be taken care of. I checked back a short time later and the picture was removed.

I had a person set me up and I was suddenly in jail. My Bachelors & Masters degree and all I have fought for suddenly seemed lost forever. My world was destroyed.\nMr. Mirer WON my case. He negotiated and I\u2019ll have a clean record again.\nPoor lawyers will give you poor results. Mr. Mirer\u2019s fee was high for me but I didn\u2019t waste a penny. I am thankful to God to have found Mr. Mirer online. He was always punctual, completely high class, professional and incredibly smart. I was certain my lawyer had no competition. Thank you forever Mr. Mirer.",

After reading all the wonderful reviews about Michael Mirer and his firm, I chose to put my trust in his law firm and was definitely not disappointed! His expertise, honesty, and commitment to success is second to none. My son\u2019s case had a very favorable result including an expungement which was the best case scenario. If you\u2019re very nervous and anxious about a legal situation like I was, I highly recommend Michael Mirer and his team. They all go above and beyond to make sure every aspect of your case is handled professionally with care and expertise!",

I made a few calls around town but Mr. Pfeiffer was the only attorney to answer his phone on a Saturday afternoon, and he took my call while at a sporting event for his child - much respect earned for that.\n\nMr. Pfeiffer not only answered my call, he took the time to answer all of my questions up front and even offered advice on what I should do even if I didnt decide to hire him. He offered me a flat rate charge, which would never increase even if additional follow-on services were needed after my initial court appearance. He charged an extremely competitive and fair price for his services.\n\nThroughout the process of working with him,  he was very reassuring and had top-notch communication with me, always answering my calls and texts in a timely manner. Mr. Pfeiffer gave me a list of things to do, told me what proof to collect and what to bring to court.\n\nOn the date of my court appearance, Mr. Pfeiffer was able to get my case dismissed and I was in the court room for a matter of minutes. The entire process was quick and painless, I was shocked at how fast it was. I think I honestly asked him \"That's it?\" afterwards. Mr. Pfeiffer was also able to recommend me to a colleague for expungement processing at a discounted rate.\n\nHe made my entire experience with court easy and pain free, at a time when I felt scared and vulnerable. I can't recommend Stephen Pfeiffer highly enough and will definitely be using him in the future for any legal issues. You will not regret hiring him, he has definitely earned my five star review.",

I\u2019ve had many attorney experiences in my life, but this one sets the bar(no pun intended) for how I hope any experience I have with dealing with any other human goes.  Extremely personable and attentive, hearing me out and laying my options before me, in a very digestible and understandable way. I came to him for expungement services, having already tried with several attorneys in the past, and due to my PTSD, I\u2019ve hit a wall with each and everyone of them, however, dealing with Rabin was nothing like any of that.\nMade me feel cared for and well represented, to put my worries and fears to bed. The overall experience was seamless and positive from beginning to end, and considering we are talking about dealing with the legal system-it\u2019s given me a whole new take on how things can go in life.\nWe all make mistakes, each and every one of us, some of us more than others.\nWhat matters after that is how we deal with these mistakes, and had I stumbled across Rabin sooner in my life, I feel I would be on a much more advanced path than I\u2019m currently am, better late than never I guess!\nWith hard work, drive, compassion, and attentiveness, I feel we can achieve anything, as long as we have the right people in our corner and on our team. I feel extremely fortunate I was able to find that in attorney Rabin Nabizadeh, and it has given me the confidence to pursue my goal of wanting to counsel the youth of the world, as I am now trying to realize my lifelong dreams of helping others in this world.\nI cannot express my gratitude enough through words, so I hope I\u2019m doing a good enough job in saying:\nTHANK YOU SO SO MUCH RABIN NABIZADEH, you are helping restore my faith in humanity, And as important-my self-confidence.",

          "text": "Last year my life turned upside down when I found myself facing felony charges. I scrambled and booked a consultation with a different attorney and by the end of the consultation I was feeling even more anxious and confused over my situation from all the talk. Thankfully I kept searching and found Summit Defense. I called and the operator immediately began taking down my information and within five minutes I was speaking with Rabin who began looking into my case. Rabin is extremely professional, communicative, and efficient; he didn't exaggerate anything and was transparent throughout the entire process. Summit Defense helped me navigate one of the scariest situations in my life, and if it weren't for Rabin's hard work, legal expertise, and experience with Bay Area courts, I'm positive the felony charges would have stuck and my life today would be completely different. Thank you Rabin and Summit Defense for helping me move on! This is the only firm I'll recommend and I'll be coming back to work with them on an expungement.",

After the experience I've had working with Ryan and Elizabeth, it would be wrong of me not to take the time to compose this review.  The work these folks do is second to none.  They are true technicians within the legal realm.  They understand 'the system'.  Above and beyond that however, they care.  Were there more stars available for this review, I would be sure to deliver each and every one of them....and without hesitation.  They are  well deserved.\n\nSome background:  one of my family members is a police officer.  When I found myself in a troubling situation with the law, I immediately went to her asking for advice on an attorney.  Ryan and Elizabeth were recommended not only by her, but too, by a number of people on the Force.  As it turns out, it was for good reason.\n\nGoing into my case, my sister explained that the nature of my charges were going to make this a difficult case to 'win'.  In fact, it was hard.  Ryan and Elizabeth were there every step of the way.  And they were responsive every hour of the day.  And, in an industry ripe with 'frauds', they proved to be the real deal - true technicians.\n\nRyan was up front with me when we first met that this case wasn't going to be an easy one.  After a grueling and stressful number of months, Ryan and Elizabeth were able to get my case dismissed.  They were creative in their approach; and they didn't ever stop.\n\nRecently, I wanted to get the case expunged.  Doing so should not have proven to be difficult given the 'continuance for dismissal' ruling I was delivered.  Turns out, it was hard indeed.  Due to the nature of my charges, we met some resistance within the system.  After an initial declination of our request, we revisited it.  And for what it's worth, taking a second stab at this wasn't ever a debate.  Elizabeth just jumped back in upon receiving the declination.  Just yesterday, I received a notification that the expungement request had been officially granted.  The records are sealed.  Ryan and Elizabeth beat the odds.  They lived up to the hype.\n\nAgain - there are not enough stars available to adequately frame up my satisfaction and appreciation with these two individuals.  If you're in need, you're in need - go meet with them.\n\n*Also, as someone that reads reviews and gets regularly skeptical about those that are overly complementary, I want to make it clear that I don't know these two people.  I had no history with them before this case.  And outside of our business dealings, I don't maintain a relationship.  I am merely a satisfied consumer of their services.  I wouldn't hesitate in referring them (and have in fact done so twice now) to friends and/or family.",

Even though no one really knew about it, I guess you could say it was  \u201chaunting\u201d me in the back of my mind and is of embarrassment to me.    Finally, I knew it was time to see if I could get this cleared up:  This criminal record happened in Mn and I currently live in TX.  I googled \u201cbest expungement attorney ...\u201d and found a list of people to sift through.   After speaking with several expungement attorneys in the twin cities area, I felt that Chris Keyser was the right fit for me.   He seemed very competent.   I\u2019ve had a terrible experience with attorneys in the twin cities area in the past so I was very apprehensive and not confident this would go well for me even though Chris seemed great. I paid what I felt was a fair price and we proceeded with the expungement filing.   Chris kept me informed throughout the process and even when we had a hiccup come from left field with someone challenging my expungement Chris proceeded with professionalism, confidence and ample communication my way.  He also went above and beyond for me in the courtroom.  I was terrified of how this was going to go down but in the end, Chris won the case and my records have been sealed.  I\u2019m finally free of this burden from my past.  Can\u2019t thank you enough, Chris.  Highly recommend him to anyone looking for expungement.    A solid  5 stars and 2 thumbs up.",

I'm happy to say my case was dismissed after long fight both inside the court room and outside. My case was not unique, but it also needed understanding of my Somali culture and Chris knew that. Also, Chris was able to fully expunge my case in all public records and court records. If you're looking for a good attorney i would not hesitate a minute if you need a proper legal representation.

Kelly is thorough, clear, and her expertise in the law goes beyond defending clients as she has actually helped write some of the new expungement laws in Minnesota. She is an expert in her field and an amazing human being to work with. Her work was very quick, efficient, and simple. I needed an attorney for a MN case but I am living in NYC and she was able to communicate with me extremely clearly over email, facetime, phone calls. So grateful to have worked with Kelly and would recommend 100% !",

Zach was extremely helpful throughout the whole process. He was polite and patient with me in answering any questions that came to mind. Zach did such an amazing job and got me a DEFERRED MISDEMEANOR (very rare for a 2nd dui in less than 10 years!) This also means I am not convicted and I will be eligible for an expungement of my arrest record. Not only that but he won the hearing for my driving privileges and I am able to keep my license!! The outcome was so much better than I could have imagined. I could not be happier with my choice of attorney and if you hire Zach Smith you will feel the same way.",

Throughout my process, Mr. Smith was available when I had questions, quick to respond to messages, greatly empathetic through the challenges foreseen in any DUI case, and I never felt like I was disrespected or \"left in the dark\".  My case was carefully taken care of with satisfying results. I never lost my license, my record was expunged to public access,  and I did not get issued to use an ignition interlock device.  Good services should always receive the credit it deserves. So, Thank You Mr. Smith for your time, help, and respectful treatment throughout my DUI process ! Highly recommended to the Tulsa community!",

          "text": "Only my second time to have the need of an attorney. I was issued a citation because my car license number was recorded by someone who alleged my offense. Really weird deal, the offense was that I through trash into a dumpster that was owned by an apartment complex. This citation was a Class C misdemeanor but showed my offense as \"Theft of Services\". I have a squeaky clean record and this is type of word \"Theft\" on anyone's record could ruin any future possibilities of employment.\nMy initial contact was at the Arlington TX. office located on Cooper St. I was greeted by 2 hispanic ladies. I explained the situation to Mory. She was very patient as I tried to explain the whole thing and how important it was for me to fight this citation. Mory took a look at my citation and made several calls for me. She initially quoted me a price of $100 to handle the representation for this citation. She could tell that was more than I was hoping to pay. I was amazed as she made another phone call and advised me the cost would be $45. Mory was very observant to notice that I had reached the last day to notify the court of my plea. If I had gone past that day, there may have been a warrant issued for my arrest. Mory typed out some legal papers for me and I ran down to the municipal court, that day,  and had the not guilty plea filed verifying my attorney as Justin Holt. My whole experience with the Arlington office was excellent.\nI received a call from the attorneys office approximately 2 weeks later following up on the citation. It was important to me to totally understand how the representation would be handled and if there would be any additional costs should I go to trial. Eventually, I found myself speaking with Justin Holt my attorney. Justin was excellent and patient explaining to me in layman's terms how he would handle the case and verifying that there would be no additional costs. Justin advised me that I would be notified within a few weeks about a possible trial date. Shortly thereafter, I received a letter that explained the upcoming events and called the office to verify. The office was very patient and explained clearly my appearance and where to meet at the municipal court. I met Justin Holt at the municipal court. Justin represented me with the judge. I was notified approximately 1 week later that the case or citation had been dismissed. The total cost for my attorney's service was $45. Can't say enough good things about this experience.\nJust to verify, I do not know Justin Holt personally or anyone else associated with his firm. Just a satisfied customer that wanted to take the time to give kudos for a job well done..",

Unfortunately my view in this law firm has completely changed.\nThis firm simply started the case, submitted paperwork for the PTI program and never followed through with anything else. My son's court officer went on leave and never returned. We tried to reach out to Austin as we were told to when I made my payment. But anytime I called I was given the runaround and told he was not available and that he would call back.. months and months of calling with no response.. I ended up having to hire a second law firm to get involved. My new lawyer simply went down to the court officers office and spoke to the supervisor to get the case moving as PTI has a time limit.. once the state had sent me the paperwork saying that PTI was complete my next step was to again reach out to the Fernandez law firm to then have the case expunged.. which I'm aware was an additional fee. I reached out to them time and time again and so did my son and every time once again there was another runaround.. either the system was down or the woman that handles expungements was not available.. another month of chasing them around with no recourse... So finally I went back to the other law firm and explain to them what was going on.. They once again took on my case for a fee.. If I had to do it all over again I would never ever use the Fernandez law firm I'm sorry they are just too irresponsible and don't give a damn about you after you pay them the fee. If I had not hired a second lawyer (after paying this firm and not getting what I paid for) to take over when they drop the ball my child would still have a felony.",

She was very understanding and willing to go that extra mile to make my wife feel comfortable through the process. The law office thought that the expungment would take 6 months or more, but we were able to get it done in half of that time. Truly great service. I hope we will never have to deal with these issues again but this firm is exceptional!!",

Their office is very responsive and was pretty proactive on making sure everything ran smoothly with the pre-trial preparations. Get a lawyer if you can. After I finish up a few more hours of community service, I'll be happy to put this mess behind me.",

By me not living in New Orleans I couldn't handle things myself so I looked for a lawyer. After talking to a few different law firms, the clear choice was Crescent City Law. They suggested that I was qualified for an expungement and the process wouldn't take long. Crescent City Law explained to me the whole process of getting my record expunged, how long it would take and how it would help me. It only took 6 months and they communicated with me throughout the process to keep me in the loop. At the end I received a digital and hard copy of my expungement. I would like to thank everyone involved in the process of my expungement and for anyone looking for a Law firm that cares, choose Crescent City Law.",

During this time, the services of Patituce & Associates were acquired; Cate drove out to meet with me to help ease any discomfort and kept mostly in contact with me when necessary, though, I would have much preferred more updates or a general hello to remind me I wasn\u2019t forgotten, but this was likely a situational feeling due to the separation.\n\nThe judge we had was extremely strict and wanted certain requirements to be completed now, but due to time restraints and the order of which things could be done and when they could be done, we had to be patient and file for motions of continuance.\n\nAs this was happening, Cate, and at one point, one of her colleagues, would meet with the prosecutor and myself at each court date with necessary evidence, updates, and advocacy and go before the judge; the charge against me would have been a felony and time served. Though the case was not dismissed, the charge was dropped to a minor misdemeanor with the ability to expunge the verdict from my record after six months, something I plan to do in the future, and no probation.\n\nI\u2019m very grateful for the work put into my case, and for the length, as it gave everyone time to do what they needed and gave me time to receive the therapy I wasn\u2019t ever really able to undergo to heal and learn from childhood trauma and the likes. I\u2019m happy to text, that due to this work we all put in, I have now established two jobs without any issue and I am able to confidently and courageously volunteer within my community and be a growing mother and companion to my family.\n\nYou have my sincerest thanks, Patituce & Associates.\n\nWith much respect,\nJ.

We hired Justin Weatherly and honestly we spoke and met with many law firms and he was the best choice. Things happen in life , sometimes just being\nAt a place at the wrong time and when you are uncertain of what the outcome will be, it is very stressful.  He took the time to thoroughly explain everything.  He was very blunt and truly did  everything he said he would.  He made sure to get every piece of evidence from police reports, body cam footage, all the way up to being booked in the jail from a couple hours prior to the arrest and after.  He told us exactly what could happen and genuinely listened to us.  While he usually does what I guess some would consider big crimes such as murder and federal cases.. he took my boyfriends case just as seriously as he did with so many others- I did a lot of research.  Not just Google reviews..I looked up dockets to similar cases.  Ours would have been a weapons under disability which would have been an F3. (I only share this because i know with reviews some want to know if their situation is similar) and we got the best outcome that could have happened. We ended up with an ammended charge of a misdemeanor and he also is helping get his record expunged so he can truly put his past behind him.  That part depends on prior charges and i think only f3s and lower. I know many have stated that he is expensive... but you get what you pay for. This law firm and Justin is worth every last cent.   He didn't promise or try to sell himself.. he was blunt, thorough, and respectful. Told us everything that could happen. He defends evidence... not just what someone says happened.  He is very respected in the court. Honestly (while we hope to never need Mr. Weatherly again) .. he would be the first and only lawyer we would contact again.  We are so grateful for all that he did for us.  If you or someone you love find yourself in a troubling legal situation- Justin Weatherly and Hmw law is definitely the defense team you want fighting for you.",

I was facing multiple felony charges and a misdemeanor 1, maximum sentence of 30 years I believe, which would have undoubtedly ruined my life if it weren't for Aaron's expertise and dedication. From the moment I hired Mr. Brockler, I knew I was in good hands. He demonstrated exceptional professionalism, attentiveness, and, legal acumen throughout the entire process. Thanks to Mr. Brockler's relentless efforts, my case was ultimately dismissed. This outcome was nothing short of a lifeline. Being acquitted of such serious charges has given me a second chance at life, and I owe it all to him. Moreover, his expertise extended beyond the dismissal of my case. He got me through the process of getting my record expunged, ensuring that the case would no longer haunt me in the future. The expungement process can be complex, but Aaron provided invaluable support and handled everything outside of me writing a letter to the judge. I wholeheartedly recommend Aaron Brockler to anyone in need of legal representation. His professionalism, expertise, and unwavering dedication make him a top-tier attorney. I am truly grateful to have had him by my side, and I can confidently say that I will never hire anyone else for any legal matters. With him as your advocate, you can rest assured that you have the best chance of achieving a favorable outcome and moving forward with your life.",

He got my felonies from two 2nd degree felonies to a plead of a 4th degree and even assured me if I wanted to keep pushing he could have all charges dropped. His paralegal team was awesome and took care of me and made sure I understood the process of everything when Myron was unavailable. I want to thank not only him but his team also as I pleaded to a charge I was okay with and took probation with an option to have my record expunged 1-3 years after my verdict. Thank you to the Watson team and hopefully I never do but if I do ever need help again he will be the first person I call. He\u2019s a man of his word. I would recommend anybody in a serious situation to retain him and he\u2019ll do the work from their!",

I made several calls to other attorneys and \"DUI Experts\" and felt that they were all talking circles around me. Some read their script so fast I couldn't keep up or understand them. Patrick is a straight shooter and I felt very comfortable with him from the start. There's no need to pay for those expensive faulty ignition interlock devices. Just trust Patrick and do exactly what he recommends. He fully represented me so I didn't even need to appear in court.  He was easily accessible and put my mind at ease through the process so I could focus on some difficult family matters. He's an expert in his field and is worthy of his stellar reputation and all his 5 star reviews. Patrick was able to get my case completely dismissed and expunged from my driving record!  I wholeheartedly endorse Patrick Bowers and his legal services.",

He\u2019s working on getting my case expunged, and I could not be happier with his services. On top of that he is always available no matter the time or day so I never had to sit and wait for him to call me back.",

Bo explained he could have this filed in court, appear in court for me\nI do not need to be present.  Have it  expunged, completed and rather quickly too which I was happily surprised!\nWe talked about fees which were seriously reasonable and it was the greatest feeling knowing this was about to be behind me.  All through the process I was provided with court dates and times. After the hearing I was contacted again to let me know it was all finished and I would be receiving a copy of the order. I didn't say I no longer reside in Kern county and Koenig came through.  I was hesitant as it was not a face to face meeting or in office. GREATEST DECISION EVER!\nThank you Koenig Law Office!",

He was a no show for my first court appearance. Also, he never wanted me to appear in court, stating that he would appear for me, which is legal but I wanted to know what was going on with my case. It was wise for me to appear at every hearing because he was working against me  I have a record and he couldn\u2019t move pass that being an ex district attorney even though I confessed my innocence. I provided him evidence and he claimed he lost it. Mr. kyle Humphrey kept telling me to get in touch with his investigator and when I did he didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. I informed him that I wanted a speedy trial and he misinformed me on what they could do to me without a witness or a victim just on a statement that was made. After fully paying him to represent me I had to go outside of his firm for accurate information. He tried to have me pay 80k for a trial and said he needed 40 k down I went with someone else and they got the charges dropped in 2 court sessions and Mr. Lyle Humphrey had me convinced that if I didn\u2019t agree to everything he wanted me to do that I was facing life. My opinion of Mr. Kyle Humphrey is if you don\u2019t have a clean record he can\u2019t or will not be willing to help you so keep your money in your pocket.",

Communication drops off right after you sign the paperwork and pay... He said he'd keep me out of jail and that wasn't true... He does the work and then boasts about how much work he did when he fails... At my arraignment he was literally shaking and his voice was cracking when the judge was trying to remand me from bail I paid twice...If I wanted someone to hold my hand through court I would have went with a Public Defender or a much cheaper lawyer. He will never take your case to trial so unless you have some crazy loop holes in your case I wouldn't even try it... DUI is one of the only crimes where the jury gets knowledge of previous DUIs so he simply won't take your case to trial with previous DUIs. If it's your first then a public defender will get you the same as he will... Total waste of money but if you're a Barbie looking Rosedale individual he will get you off. I watched him get someone off Scott free that was going to court with during my DUI court dates... I could hear what they were discussing in the hallway before court and this woman's DUI was much worse than mine... Im sure they make deals with the DAs on which get off and who's going to be the sacrificial lamb. Do yourself the favor and get a public defender if it's your first or second.\n\nHe also failed miserably on my expungement too... Before I paid him he swore up and down he could get it 100% expunged which wasn't true.. After our last court date he informed me that expungement is \"discretionary\" which he didn't explain while we signed the paper work. If I knew it was going to be a gamble I wouldn't have forked over the money. I would never use this guy again or even refer him to anyone.",

I got my father\u2019s case dismissed thanks to their great work. I am very thankful I gave them my father\u2019s case to represent him in court. I could not have asked for better representation than Mo Abuershaid from All Trial Lawyers. He eased all of my worries from the get go and assured me every step of the way. In the end, I was in the best hands possible for my case. Thank you Mo. You are a life saver. I hired Mo as my option since I had never been in such a point in my life and glad to say that was the best decision ever made. Not only does he answer my phone and return phone calls which is a good thing, he does what he says! If you need an attorney to help you out when things are against you I fully recommend Mo Abuershaid! Pretty much the best criminal attorney I have ever had. Thanks Mo for what you do, your the greatest. Had my father\u2019s record cleared up and couldn\u2019t be more grateful. If you ever need an attorney anytime fo the day for any reason he is simply a call away and will definitely ensure you he will have everything take care of with such ease which relieved me when I was in pain with this case helped me understand very throughly about how everything works and what\u2019s going on and kept me up on updates frequently. Thanks once again Mo.",

I asked them to represent me through the process of expunging my criminal record. The courts initially denied it, but after completing my full term of probation, Lifeback Legal brought my case back to court, asking again for my record to be expunged, and it was granted the second time around. Lifeback Legal made this process smooth and easy for me. Thank you. This was truly lifechanging for me. Thank you Shea and Priscilla for your support through this. Thank you for your quick and thorough communication. Thank you for taking are of the paper work and court appearances for me. I am beyond grateful. This was such an easy process with your help.",

They have a fair price for all of their services, they are very clear in the process and very transparent in what services will be provided. Priscilla is the para legal who is your go to, but she is very knowledgeable and keeps you informed on a Very personal level. We arent just nameless clients, she and Shea are very aware of who you are and what your case needs are. They know what they are saying and WHO they are saying it to, its a great feeling to not feel like just another dollar sign for a law office. Yes we are their business but still...good customer service ia a must!\n\nDue to covid my case took 7 instead of 2 or 3 months and it took patience but not once did I feel like the team would let me down or trick me out of my money since no progress could be made. A google review just doesnt do any justice to describe how much they helped me and how excellent they are at what they do. Professional, personal, fair and they sure know how to communicate with great articulation and clarity to clients and courts. I could not be happier with their services!",

As soon as I met Kia it felt like he was going to listen to me and get me the help and representation I needed. Even when I was feeling uncertain he assured me he was helping me as best he could and we were working towards a good result. I went from facing over 5 years to not having to set foot into a jail. On top of that Kia was there when I needed my expungement 3 years later and got it done surprisingly quickly! From working with him to working with his Paralegal Lucia, it was a smooth ride. All in all a great experience and I will definitely recommend him to anyone that needs legal representation.",

I explained the hold that this incident has had on my personal well being & level of confidence walking into a job interview.. The circumstances were a little outside the box.. After speaking with Kia & staff, my level of concern weren\u2019t gone but, definitely had eased my mind with the level of knowledge & confidence..\nI just got the call, EXPUNGED\u2026.!!\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this review, don\u2019t waste anymore time & call Kia Law Firm..!!\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU KIA..!

From the moment I met him in court I felt a positive energy around him and he never once made me feel like I was being judged based on my mistakes. He is very easy to talk to. At the end of the entire process he was able to have my case dismissed and even educated me on the process of getting my record expunged. I can never thank him enough for what he has done for me. If you\u2019re blessed enough to have him as your court appointed attorney you can rest assure that he will not disappoint you. Thank you Mr. Delgado and God bless you!!!",

In five months time, every one of my charges were court filed, appeared before and signed by the judges. 10/10 I'd recommend him to you.",

She is a compassionate, knowledgeable, and impressive legal expert who was able to get my case completely dismissed with prejudice (permanently) and the erroneous charges expunged from my record. When I walked into Brandi\u2019s office, she made me feel believed and valued and encouraged me throughout the process. Anytime I called or texted her, she was always readily available to answer my questions, and she indeed showed a vested interest in my case and my emotional well-being. Brandi made me feel like I was a part of her family and went to bat for me like any big sister would (at least, that\u2019s how I felt). Moreover, Brandi is well respected and connected in the legal community and can use her experience to leverage the best possible outcomes. If you are looking for an attorney who can provide respect and results, look no further than Brandi Lewis!",

          "text": "I was referred to Attorney James Gempeler at Northstar Criminal Defense by a close friend of mine. I was looking to have my DWI record expunged due to charges from 13 or 14 years ago. I had run into issues with finding employment, apartments, etc. as a result of my criminal record, and mistakes I had made when I was much younger. I didn't have much hope that I could successfully have my record expunged because I had previously talked to an attorney who told me that it was not possible. So I called James without high expectations, and met with him within a couple of days.\n\nJames was very honest and transparent with me about the potential hurdles, but assured me he was up for the challenge. He was very well educated about expungement law, and was citing sources that might be applicable to our case. He guided me step-by-step through the entire process letting me know what to expect and how to mentally prepare. He was fantastic during our court appearance. He had clear knowledge of all of the nuances of my case and was able to articulate them accurately to the judge and the opposing attorney.\n\nThis was a very emotional process for me, as I have a lot of shame surrounding the pour choices I made when I was younger - so much so that I have dedicated my professional career to helping individuals and families affected by addiction. And I was grateful that James always treated as a human being with compassion and respect. I never once felt judged for my mistakes.\n\nI am thrilled to say that we got the outcome we had hoped for thanks to James' hard work. My record will officially be sealed, and I will be able to move forward and continue to help more people who struggle without being held back by my criminal record. When I found out the court found in my favor, I sobbed for almost an hour as I had believed this would be something that would haunt me for the rest of my life. To have this burden removed from my shoulders so that I can continue to be a positive contributor to society is a freedom I didn't expect to know. I am confident to say I won't need James' services in the future from criminal defense or expungement representation, but I would gladly recommend him to anyone looking to move forward from previous legal mistakes.",

          "text": "In early 2022 my 21-year-old son was arrested and charged with 7 felonies and his bail was set at a million dollars.  His Public defender encouraged him to take a 1st degree sales charge right away.  I called around a handful of criminal defense attorneys that quoted me outrageous fees to retain their services and the tone in their voices seemed so grim.\n\nEverything changed when I contacted Repka Law.  Dan called me back the same day.  He was so upbeat, positive, and ready to take on the task of getting the best possible outcome for my son.  It was 3 days before my son\u2019s next hearing and Dan said immediately he wanted to be there to let it be known that my son would not be rolling over to a plea deal - and that he would fight for my son as if he were his own.  Needless to say, he got the job!\n\nMy son\u2019s case took over a year in District Court\u2013in that time Dan filed several motions to try and have his bail reduced and to ask for opportunities for him to go to treatment (he had everything lined up and ready if they agreed).  Each motion was denied, and we all were getting frustrated and feeling defeated, but Dan never gave up the good fight or lost hope.  Dan and I were in regular communication, and he called me before and after every hearing; to say I texted him a lot over the past few years would be an understatement :) He was always super responsive and supportive. He also had regular legal calls with my son throughout the entire process.\n\nAfter Dan had looked over the evidence, or lack thereof, he concluded in his opinion that the search warrant lacked probable cause and the entire case should be dismissed.  The district court disagreed.  My son ended up not accepting any plea, was found guilty at a court trial on 1 charge of 2nd Degree Possession and sentenced to 48 months in prison.\n\nDan subsequently filed an appeal and argued my son\u2019s case at the MN Court of Appeals like a RoCkStAr!! We lost a lot of battles along the way in District Court, but Dan ultimately won the war \u2013 and with a Precedential Published opinion at that! Justice prevailed!  My son\u2019s entire conviction was reversed/vacated and he was able to walk out of Prison after 27 months of incarceration-  free from any type of supervision or parole and is now starting the process of getting his civil rights restored and the immediate expungement from his record.\n\nMy family will forever be grateful for Dan \u2013  I cannot thank him enough for never giving up and for seeing this to the end. I consider him a dear friend and trusted confidant.  I honestly could not have made it through all of this without his kindness, support, wisdom, patience, empathy, and great sense of humor.   Dan knows the law; he has the endurance to keep fighting fearlessly for your rights and is not intimidated to face any legal battle. If you find yourself in a fight against any criminal charge Dan is who you want and need by your side!\n\nHis staff Mary and Andrea were also very respectful and supportive throughout this entire ordeal and deserve a shoutout as well!  Thank you all for everything!",

He takes the time to answer your questions and to keep you at ease throughout the entire case. I think sometimes he even surprises himself. After my charges were dropped and my case was he went on and got my record expunged which helped so much in getting a job. My first background check I was biting my nails and it came back squeaky clean.\nHis crew is prompt and answer the phone right away, if they can't answer the phone they call you back within minutes. They all are on board they all are aware of what's going on and they are all professional.\nI highly recommend Mark Kelly.",

Tanner set up appointments with me before every court date and came to every court date well read, well studied, and well prepared. All my charges were expunged. There is no other defense lawyer I rather hire. Tanner turned an overwhelming and stressful series of events into a great and pleasant experience!",

Because of Alex, I didn\u2019t have to travel from Columbus to Cincinnati for court 4 out of the 5 times, which saved me a ton of time and stress. She was always prompt in responding to any questions I had and kept me updated throughout the entire process. In the end, she got my case dismissed and everything expunged from my record. If you're looking for a lawyer who is professional, efficient, and truly fights for you, Alex is the one!",

A professional indeed. Great communication and obviously she knows her stuff because, motion granted. I highly recommend this young lady if you need representation. Thank you again Alex!",

Mr. Gerson handled everything with such skill and dedication that we felt completely confident throughout the process.\n\nThanks to Mr. Gerson's efforts, our son's case was not only dismissed, but also expunged from his record. This has made a big difference in his life, and we can't express enough how much we appreciate the hard work and attention to detail that went into his defense.\n\nWhat really stood out to us was Mr Gerson's communication and transparency. Every step of the way, we were kept informed and felt fully supported. He was always available to answer questions and offered thoughtful advice that made a stressful situation much easier to navigate.\n\nWe highly recommend Mr. Gerson to anyone in need of a skilled, compassionate, and results-oriented attorney. We are forever grateful for the outstanding outcome and the positive impact it has had on our family.\n\nThank you again Mr Gerson for your hard work and dedication!",

I found myself in serious trouble and she immediately got on the case and told me from the very beginning I have a great case to go to trial and believed in me and being victorious, I followed my heart and the great legal advice from my lawyer and by the almighty god I was found not guilty. I watched Ms. Tramontozzi work work work work work and work beyond hard to help me and  defend me countless hours, late nights and early mornings with constant help, which put me in a great position to have a future I want and desire . This is the BEST lawyer in Winston Salem and this law firm is top tier number one and would recommend ANYONE to go with them for any situation because will would\u2019ve the issue, I thank Dummit Fradin and Anastasia Tramontozzi for the great work believing in me treating me and my family as if we\u2019re family every step of the way and helping me through everything",

The ticket was written in the wrong name from the registration even though I was the only individual in the car. When I spoke with the attorney for the consultation I was assured I would not have to appear in court if i singed an affidavit.\nWhen I was sent the affidavit there were multiple spelling errors that I had to correct before signing it and returning it to the office.\nIn the end, both I and the other person on the registration had to appear in court. This was because there was a discrepancy between what the citation stated and what the attorney stated in court. They had to subpoena the Trooper to court.\nThe attorney then showed up over a hour late to court and did not greet us or speak to us until our case was called. The ticket was dismissed due to the Trooper not appearing, but I should have saved my money and handled it myself. When I asked about an expungement, they wanted us to pay more for that than the ticket itself. Working in a law firm myself, this sounded ridiculous and the situation was not handled well.\nThe only reason I am giving two stars is because London was a wonderful assistant.",

He made sure to exhaust every possible option and always had a backup plan in case our initial strategy didn\u2019t go as planned. Jeremy was always responsive and got back to me in a timely manner. Ultimately, my ENTIRE case got dropped and record sealed. Could not recommend this man enough!!! Not to mention, he was the least expensive attorney in the area for DUI cases. I was able to be up front and honest about everything and Jeremy assured me he would do everything he could to make this go away, and he did. If this ever happened to you, lawyer up and lawyer up with Jeremy!",

They listened and didn't assume I knew what to expect or that I was familiar with the criminal justice system. Once they pulled the records together, they created a plan and set it in motion.  COVID slowed things down but they never failed to answer my calls and/or emails.   The office team is cordial and efficient. Once I called their office by mistake and hung. They recognized the missed call and called me back!\n\nI stress enough that they were responsive, compassionate, and knowledgeable.  They worked hard on my case and never failed to let me know they cared about the resolution that I wanted. My case was finally dismissed and expunged!  By the way, the fee was very reasonable.\n\nI recommend the Crowder Law Firm, without reservation!\n\nCrowder Law Firm, THANK YOU, truly!",

Facing these two charges put me in a really hard time for a few months but with the Wilder Law Firm\u2019s help, I was able to put all this past me and move on with a clean record. This was a hard life lesson but I am thankful for the results",

I am so happy the firm believed in me the entire way through my case. They were always on my side and even when I was hesitant to fight the case because of the stress involved, I trusted and listened to their advice and it ended up saving my record from a conviction. They ended up getting rid of the DWI for me and I only have to do a short non-reporting probation. I will also be able to get this expunged from my records! This whole process has taught me a lot and I can promise I will never even drink one drink and drive in the future. Life it too short. I took this time to really learn a lot about different things and can walk away knowing the Wilder Law Firm got me through the hardest time. I want to thank each and every one of them. My life was turned upside down and now I feel like I can breathe again. Thank you so much",

He HAS TO BE WRITING his own positive review because there is no way he should be admired for his professionalism. I gave him over 1k to complete expungement HE said I was eligible for on 10/9/19. Literally did not hear from him after multiple emails and texts over the 1st 5 months. After about 6 months he sends 1 text saying my expungement was approved but he was waiting for them to send the paperwork. I waited almost another 2 months i texted him for my paperwork and he text back saying he would look into. He called me back 1 time to say he messed up and didnt realize he couldnt do the expungement due to me having a non-disclosure on a prior case. I called down to the court house and they advise me he missed my the court appearance so it didn\u2019t go through. After numerous texts to him he responds i will look into it when I get  back from vacation. Another month or so goes by. He texted me back a one-liner saying he would do my non-disclosure for this case for free since he messed up on the expungement. Basically since 10/2019 I have spoken to him once. I AM FILING A GRIEVANCE with TX bar assoc. AND I still have no paperwork. PLEASE DONT USE HIM!!! He is the worst \u201cprofessional\u201d and a nightmare to deal with.

Furthermore, I had gotten an unfortunate DV case for arguments and marks when I called them a second time. They worked magic and got my case fully dismissed, whilst expunging my record of the arrest. I greatly appreciate this law firm and would recommend them to anyone for any case.\nKeep in mind, they are very intelligent lawyers who may help you with even the worst kinds of charges. I would give them 10 stars or more if I could.\nJoe was also very helpful and informative, ensuring I have the confidence to continue daily trusting that this professional law firm will represent me beyond proficiently.",

Cohen & Associates handled everything with expertise and confidence. They were experts in to tackling every single hurdle and educated me well enough to make the best possible informed decisions. My Attorney Mary was straight forward and made herself available regardless of office hours. They have a great professional relationship with the District Attorney and court in obtating multiple hearings and reviews of my case. They advocated for me as if I was part of their own family. I'm incredibly thankful for their hard work and dedication to get my case dismissed. Even after my dismissal the owner of the firm Attorney Corey Cohen responded to my email on a Saturday at 4AM to answer some of my questions and offer additional services for expungement at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend them. Their service helped me feel like my rights and personal interests were their top priority. They always had time for me made me feel as if I was their only client. They're compassionate efficient and effective. Look no further hire them.",

Within a matter of days retaining Cohen Law, my case was dismissed by the state and now working on getting my file expunged. Well worth every penny to secure my freedom and peace of mind going forward. Mr. Brown was amazing and took the time to answer all of the questions I had, and the support staff were in constant communication with me and excellent. Thank You Thank You Thank You!",

I highly recommend Attorney Wiseman he is professional, honest, truthful, caring, gentle, kind, compassionate, faithful and returns calls (so does his wonderful staff) he also went above and beyond the call of duty to help us when we didn't know where to turn. Thank you attorney Wiseman from my whole heart you were truly sent from heaven to help my family.",

He did respond to me quickly every time I had questions or concerns. Also he told me that as long as I listen to him, I would get the best result for my situation because each case is different. I liked that he told me so advance the same day that I called him for free consultation and signing up for him to be my lawyer, that exactly what steps I needed to take. For example: he told me to contact my insurance regarding the accident, he told me what DUI classes I need to take with the right person to take them, he told me the best place to take community service which is \u201cSomeone who cares soup and kitchen in Costa Mesa\u201d and the MAAD course which was only 2 hours. And I did go through all that right away. Why not!? He advices me that even though I didn\u2019t get charge for hit and run, the DA might still charge me which that happened! He helped to dismiss my case hit and run so I only got convicted for misdemeanor DUI and he even told me that after 3 years, he can help me to expunge it. Barbara is also very nice and professional the same as Mr Vincent Tucci. She is also very quick Witt responding her clients. Before getting a lawyer, some people told me that I don\u2019t need a lawyer. But, it\u2019s so much easier with a lawyer, quicker and not to forget about the peace of mind that comes with it. Thank you Mr Tucci and Ms Barbara \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f",

I managed the DMV myself, but as I was getting closer to my trial date I realized that I really had no idea what I was doing and needed a lawyer.   I had received a variety of contacts from lawyers but after some Internet research Braden and Tucci were the ones that stuck out.   Boy, am I glad that I chose them.    Vincent Tucci handled my case from initial contact to court room appearance.  He was able to get me a 12 month probation with dismissal at the end of 12 months.   What a relief.  I thank Vincent for his expertise and hard work and really am glad he's there to help out idiots like me!\n\nPS:  It has been a year + since my conviction.  I have paid the fine and finished my probation. Vincent Tucci emailed me to inform me that was now eligible to have my conviction expunged and requested if I would like to proceed with that .  I  did and their office took care of the entire process.  My record is now expunged and I am quite happy.  Vincent and T&B did a great job for me.   I am so glad I found them.",

While doing research about ending my probation early and expunging my record, I came across Adam Stull's firm  which focused on what I was looking for. From the first time I spoke with Adam, he was very attentive and responsive to my needs. He was willing to meet in a location that was more convenient for me to discuss my case which not everyone is willing to do. My court date was set for mid March which is when COVID-19 and all the courts closed. At the time, I filled with anxiety as I was running out of time before I had to apply for jobs. However, Adam comforted me and let me know that he would make sure that my case would be first on the docket as soon as the court would allow it. On July 1st, my second court date to terminate my probation early, the court decided that my case was not a priority and would delay it until late September. Of course, Adam worked diligently to get me a date for early august. Fast forward to today, September 29, 2020, my probation has been terminated early and record has been expunged all because of Adam Stull. Despite the setbacks that were out of our control, he worked hard and made sure that this was a smooth stress free process for me.",

Well worth the money, and prices is definitely reasonable, i was fighting a case for 9 months, and first she got the case which was originally a Superior Court case downgraded to a Municipal Court case. While at the Municipal Court hearing she found a flaw in the case that nobody but her noticed and she was quick to bring it up and was able to get the whole case dismissed!! and just recently I received paperwork in the mail for all charges to be expunged!!! And my fianc\u00e9e recommended her to me and she has also won her case as well!! I will recommend her for anyone and if i need to in the future i most definitely will use her services again!!",

He said that if you want a \"nice guy\" attorney, find someone else, but if want to win, call Ralph Frasier. Just wanted to share our experience and his referral!\nNCCU Eagles Household",

          "text": "Thanks for getting my case dismissed before the court date! Attorney Gint, you're the best!\n\nI don't typically write reviews / not big fan of it. However, Gint's service compelled me to share my experience, hoping it helps others in similar situations.\n\nI recently received a citation in Wilmington for failure to yield the right of way. As this was my first ticket, I contacted several attorneys. With most firms, I only spoke to receptionists or assistants who took notes but never connected me with an attorney, despite my preference for direct communication. Again I am not against of speaking with the Legal Assistants but its always good to speak with the person who will represent on your behalf at the court.\n\nAfter speaking with various firms, I connected with attorney Gint. What stood out from our first conversation was how patiently he listened to my situation. He explained all possibilities, from best to worst-case outcomes, including how the ticket would impact insurance and DMV points. He addressed all my questions during that first interaction and suggested documents that could help get the case dismissed.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks, I gathered all the information and retained him. He was very prompt in responding to calls and emails, maintaining clear communication throughout the process. His organizational and documentation skills are excellent. Even after retaining him, he continued to respond promptly to all my questions and maintained the utmost professionalism with a sense of ownership and clarity. He clearly cares for his clients.\n\nHe suggested a plan of action and, using New Hanover County's new e-court system, documented my case and evidence. He successfully got my ticket dismissed well before the court date, saving me from having to travel to NC since I'm not a resident. He even offered to help with the expungement letter paperwork at no additional cost. He is a kind and empathetic person.\n\nI highly recommend retaining him without hesitation if he's willing to take your case. If he sees merit in your case, trust his guidance and follow his input completely. Happy to talk to you if you have any questions.",

What should have been a simple intervention for addiction became an exaggerated criminal accusation with the State seeking maximum life altering sentences.\n\nMy wife and I were very fortunate to have had Dan recommended to us and from the very beginning Dan did all that he could do to defend our son from an over-zealous DA. Dan was successful in reducing or clearing some of the charges, although a single felony remained despite his valiant efforts.\n\nThis is were most attorneys would have given themselves a pat on the back and called it a day, but not Dan. He cared! He continued to fight to help for the early release of our Son to an addiction treatment center which Dan found HIMSELF!\n\nOur Son has had a complete turn around in his life, due greatly to Dan and his team's involvement! Even then, our Son had the stigma of a Felony record that has stymied much of his ability to move forward...\n\nUntil today! Today my wife, our Son and I attended court with Dan's associate Jon who successfully argued for the State to expunge our Son's record!!! Dan's team has yet again gone above and beyond so as to allow us to recover from a past mistake and instead have the ability to look forward to a much brighter future!\n\nThank you to everyone at San Diego Defenders! We will always be grateful!",

His professionalism, responsiveness, and expertise made a huge difference, and I\u2019m extremely grateful for his help.

From the very beginning, he was understanding, professional, and incredibly knowledgeable about the expungement process. He took the time to explain everything clearly and address all my concerns.\n\nThroughout the case, Mr. Lackey kept me informed of every step and was always available to answer my questions. He worked diligently to achieve the best possible outcome, and I'm thrilled to say my record was successfully expunged!\n\nIf you're looking for an expungement lawyer who is truly dedicated to helping his clients, look no further than criminal defense attorney Ryan lackey. Thanks to him, I have a fresh start, and I'm incredibly grateful!",

He contacted the county, and within 2 months I received paperwork in the mail from the courts saying my record was expunged. He also responded to my texts within the same day when I had questions.\nI highly recommend hiring a lawyer to try to get that expungement, as it is something the court will only let you try once in a lifetime. This lawyer is an excellent choice. A longtime weight of feeling like a lesser person in society has finally been lifted off my shoulders. I say in the nicest way possible that I hope I never need his services again.",

He knows the process, figures out your best options, takes the time to fully understand your situation, and works with you and your family to make it through all of the hoops you may not even know exist. He does a lot of the backend work and keeps that away from you, so that you and your families are able to focus on getting your lives together after a traumatic moment in your lives. His staff is friendly, always accommodatin, and they work to find the solution to anything you bring to their table, always with you and your best interests in mind. Trust is huge with any attorney, and sometimes what's best for you, isn't what you want, or think it is. Niko and his staff work diligently to make sure you comprehend the process well, and help you understand your best options dependent upon the court, the judge, and your action.\n\nMy time with him is invaluable and I appreciate all the work he did for me and especially, my family, in my greatest time of need. He kept it together for me, even when I flew off the handle a little and I owe him my life.\n\nHe also helps with expungement processes and charges a very fair price for the work. After that's over and done with, I'll never come back here again! \ud83d\ude09 Except maybe just to say, \"hello!\"",

I called Seth that Sunday, he not only returned my call within minutes, but before the day was out Seth was signed up to represent me. From that day forward Seth took charge, explained every step and all of my options along the way. I opted for the County's domestic violence diversion program for anger management rather than a trial. The end result for me after successfully completing a 12 class program within 2 months is that all charges have been dropped and my case is closed. Seth is now working on getting my arrest record expunged and when processed there will be no record that this unfortunate incident ever happened. What more could you ask of an attorney! If you need this kind of help, call Seth Shapiro if you want the best legal solution to your problem.",

My attorney Seth Shapiro was proficient at his job and relentless in his pursuit to get this case dismissed. Seth proved to the D.A. that upon further investigation of this case by the State Attorney's Office it was revealed that further prosecution was not warranted. My case was Nolle Prosequi, which means it was dismissed by the prosecution. This was the best outcome I could of have ever wished for. On top of that my arrest record is on its way to being expunged. What an amazing Law Firm. Seth Shapiro was caring, and forthright with me.

He has helped me in more ways than one, because of Mr. Kilfin's hard work I will remain a free man and still have a clean record!! As any of you know that peace of mind is priceless.\n\nDonnie was more than an exceptional lawyer practicing at the top of his profession. He consistently went above and beyond in all aspects of handling my case. He personally kept me informed of how my case was evolving. Always calling me himself with updates often on the weekend. Donnie was always reachable by cell for any advisement or questions that I had.\n\nWithout a doubt Donnie was a blessing. He represented a family member a decade ago and got his case dismissed, so when I needed to retain an attorney my parents knew just who to call. In fact, other attorneys I spoke with thought I was done for but Donnie was confident from the get go that he could get my case dropped.\n\nDo yourself a favor and sit down with Donnie Kilfin for a consultation regarding your circumstances. You will not regret it. I pray I never need his services again but if I do I wouldn't use any other criminal attorney. Donnie has earned my respect and appreciation. He is the GOAT in my opinion.",

After calling around a few different law offices to inquire about an expungement case, I found Michael Pastacaldi\u2019s office. Within a couple of minutes of speaking to him, I knew that I could stop my search.\n\nMichael is extremely down to earth. In speaking with him, you can sense his sincerity and passion. He will speak to you as if you and he are equals without casting judgement. He answered every question I had, both related and unrelated to my case, and outlined the process and what to expect perfectly. He took the time to understand who I am/the particulars of my case and then quickly tailored the best approach possible based on that to suit my needs. He is also very easy to reach, not that you\u2019ll feel like you need to as he checks in and updates you with any news/progress. He is extremely knowledgeable and a true professional who has perfected his craft. My expungement was granted without any issues and even went through quicker than anticipated, which is especially impressive during the backlog of court cases this pandemic has created.\n\nI highly recommend using Michael Pastacaldi as your attorney and only wish I had found him earlier. Thank you for everything Michael!!",

Every case is different, and it wasn't quick or cheap, but this is one of the best investments I ever made.  I went from feeling like just a convicted felon to a normal guy.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

He took his time with me, explained in detail the process, he made no false promises, and most importantly he gave me hope and reassurance.  Mr. Ciccarelli and his team are extremely knowledgeable, professional, and he is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  He was able to get my driving charges dropped and got me fast tracked as a first-time offender.  I had a rough road ahead of me with the DUI, but with Mr. Ciccarelli\u2019s help, I was able to navigate through the process and I am again working with Mr. Ciccarelli to have my case expunged from my records.  I highly recommend Lee Ciccarelli and The Ciccarelli Law Firm.",

Mehlos offered a plan in regards of getting this case down to a deferred prosecution and potentially expunged off my record. All said and done we ended with a deferred prosecution plea to two class (A) misdemeanors and after 12 months of good behavior on bond, it will be expunged from the records with no jail time!! Exactly what we had planned from the get-go! Definitely would recommend them to others. Thank you all involved for the great experience, couldn't have asked for a better turnout!!",

I almost died. I did not mean to hurt anyone except myself and I needed help. I was charged with 2 felony and 3 misdemeanor charges and Corey really helped me along the way with both giving me an opportunity to get all my charges expunged off my record if I successfully completed probation and also to figure out a program where I could work on my issues so nothing like this ever happened again. I felt absolutely horrible that someone else got hurt in the accident but it was a challenge to work through the stress of the case. But only did Corey help me get the chance to not have my life timed by felony charges, he was there for me and helped me figure out the right help. The DA was really aggressive at times and I think we took one or two weeks of court because he would fight with Corey over just about everything, but Corey didn\u2019t back down an inch and I always felt he had my\u00a0\u00a0back. I now find myself in a much better place and appreciate everything Corey did to help me get a second chance in life. Corey wasn\u2019t just our attorney, he became a good friend and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful that we found him.",

After 6 weeks, I reached out of anxiety and they again assured that even if the judgement is not in our favor, we can appeal and try to reduce the fine further. There will be ample scope for negotiations.\n\n2 months went by and received a decision from attorney directly in mail. The speeding fine was reduced only by 1 category, because of clean record. From $300 to $200+. When I enquired with attorneys to possibly appeal, they mentioned that it is not possible. I was told that their only objective was to avoid a suspension.\nI have no issues with paying fine, but I have issue with lying. When I hired them, they had set completely different expectations and also lied in the middle during my enquiry. Later after outcome, they changed the tune . I know I cant argue with lawyers, but being non truthful is not a good sign.  Also, I was clarified that during the entire process there was no real negotiation with public prosecutor. They just submit documents and wait for a response or result.",

Lanehart said for me to accept a plea with deferred adjudication. I understood that as long as i complete without problems , that my conviction would not show up ..only an arrest. Well let me tell you it doesn't say nothing about arrest , it shows I pled guilty and was sentenced to deferred adjudication for my charges. Ever since my life has been hell filled with disappointment after disappointment with jobs turning me down for a 25 year old guilty plea that I thought details would be vague and only show I was arrested! I was arrested as a 19 year old in 98 and I'm 50 now and I keep losing opportunities for jobs even this long after. It was my first offense , I was eligible for probation on that merit alone , when the main defendent explained it was only him and he got decades but tried to show that I wasnt guilty just gave a guy a ride and he chose to do it himself and looking back, i feel chuck chose to plead me and didnt offer to go to court had i gotten convicted , id still have  deffered adjudication but i could of expunged my record but because i pled guilty i cant have it expunged and because i didnt understand the magnitude of my choice i cannot find employment . Lanehart left me destroyed.",

He didn\u2019t promise me a rose garden, but he did promise that he will do everything he can for the best result and be an aggressive negotiation. I was glad I hired him, and he took over my case not even a week before my second pretrial conference. He was able to do a quick proper turnover with the previous attorney. He also kept the line of communication open and answered all my questions. I became very confident with him representing me in my case from day one. On my third pretrial conference he explained in detail multiple approaches to get the best result. He was able to negotiate a diversion in my case which I was very grateful, and it allowed me to be able to have a clean record so I will always be able to provide for my daughter in her future. I will highly recommend Mr. Sparling and is the best representation of Rosenstein Law Group.",

          "text": "I was involved in an unfortunate accident that resulted in me getting arrested at the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport for felony trespassing. upon release I had to find a lawyer to try and fight my case. I called around to five different law firms and was treated like a customer at a car dealership and not a real person. I also never spoke to an actual lawyer -- only the legal assistants or associates -- and on top of that the average retainer was anywhere between $7,500-$12,000 just to get my case started. I truly felt like they didn't care about me at all.... After struggling to find a lawyer that I felt comfortable with representing my case, I reached out to Mike at Tamou Law Group and was honestly blown away!! not only did I speak with Mike directly the first time I called, but I genuinely felt as though he cared about me and getting me the lowest punishment possible. He also said that he would take on my case for only $5,000!! I decided to go with Mike  and it was the best decision I could've ever made! he was responsive the entire process and made sure I understood everything that was going on the whole time. due to his previous experience as a public defender, he was able to get my case pushed through to the felony diversion program almost immediately which meant I didn't have to return for court and that upon completion of the diversion program the charge would be expunged from my record! on top of that, I was being civilly sued by the Department of Homeland Security which was a separate case from the one that I originally hired Mike for. I was facing a $15,000 fine and had to write a letter to DHS explaining my case and the events that had taken place the night of the arrest. Mike went above and beyond for me by assisting with my letter and got me waived of all fines!! I could not be happier with my decision to have Mike represent me. if you or someone you know is in some unfortunate legal trouble, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Mike Tamou at Tamou law group. it was seriously the best $5,000 I have ever spent!!! Thank you again Mike!!",

I received a criminal speeding ticket (for going 94 mph in a 75-mph zone) that Mr. Monarrez was able to get completely dismissed.  My sole requirement was the completion of a defensive driving course.  I could not afford a criminal charge on my record because I am a nurse and did not want to jeopardize my practice.  Additionally, I had just retired from the Army, after 20 years of service, with a very clean record and I wanted to keep it that way.  Mr. Monarrez and Ms. Lopez were in constant communication with me (via phone AND email) and they effectively explained complicated legal issues in an easy-to-understand manner.  They were frequently keeping me informed of any updates and all of my options.  This team of lawyers and legal assistants has surpassed the many lawyers and legal assistants that I have dealt with in the past (due to divorce and child custody).  They are well worth the money spent and I would highly recommend them to any family and friends looking for remarkable legal services.  I am so grateful for Mr. Monarrez, Noemi Lopez, and the entire R&R Law Group for their incomparable professionalism.  Thank you so much!!!",

John is forever grateful for Dylan's knowledge, persistence, and honesty concerning his case.  We are pleased to announce the case was dismissed and his record will be expunged. If you need an attorney who will be honest and upfront with you, who knows the law, and really wants the best possible outcome Dylan is the best around!! He won't sugar coat anything just to get your money. He will tell you what he thinks he can do and then he does it! Dylan thank you for everything!\n\nJuly 2023.  My husband and I went to see Attorney Greenwood when we had lost hope of anyone actually caring that the charges my husband was facing were not true. Dylan listened to everything that we had to say and we are ecstatic with the outcome! I can't think of another Attorney in this area with the knowledge, capability, and compassion to see that justice is served. I would recommend him to anyone facing a difficult case. He is worth every $ .\nThank you again for everything!\n\nJohn & Jennifer",

Pricing was so reasonable considering the hard work & thought he put into this. If he offers the service your needing, just go ahead and get it done through him for the best results. After one conversation with him you\u2019ll know he\u2019s the one, trust me. He has a good relationship with the people down at the courthouse, and his secretary\u2019s were very sweet with me even though I called a lot of times on the day of the expungement decision. They understood how important this was to my family. His office is also really beautiful and neat, other lawyers we went to had papers everywhere or were disorganized but it looks amazing and is in a great location! He was very straight forward, told us when finalized paperwork would come back and prices are seriously reasonable. Other firms were trying to charge me double and would say they would \u201ctry but aren\u2019t certain\u201d. Dylan Greenwood gave me a price and details of what the charges were for and said \u201cI can and I will\u201d. Thank you SO SO much Greenwood Law!",

We didn't really know anything about Mr Fitzgerald when we hired him.\n\nIt did not take us long to realize what we had in a lawyer, he was able to get our sons bail reduced enough so we could afford to bail him out and it was significantly reduced! He told us in the beginning that it would be a long process in his case, and he was right. Mr Fitzgerald was straight up with us about everything throughout the whole case, he didn't sugar coat anything and we had no surprises along the way, his office staff was great and they were always very friendly and curious to us...\n\nSeveral times throughout my sons case I would tell people, if they ever needed a good defense attorney, and I hope they never did, that I knew a great one and his name is John Fitzgerald!!! I mean that from the bottom of my heart. We were truly so blessed when we hired him. I would not recommend anyone else to represent me as a defense attorney.\n\nIf I could give him 10 star recommendation I would, he was able to get all of my sons felony charges dropped and the expungment process is taking place at this time, and there were 31 felonies all together. Mr Fitzgerald was truly a God send to us!!!!",

I had to call them because I received a letter from the municipal court that nobody showed up and had 10 days to appeal the decision, which they did. The second mistake they made was they tried to send me to the wrong courthouse, Frank Crowley Courts Building, when my trial was in the Municipal Court. Then a lawyer from there called me and said that the court tried to negotiate with me and dismiss one ticket and pay for the other one and I wouldn't have to go to trial if I accepted, and he kept insisting that my trial was on Friday 08/09 when it was actually on Thursday 08/08. I would've missed my trial if I listened to him. Then, they insisted on me accepting the courts offer, but I insisted and made them go to trial because that's why I hired them, to dismiss both my tickets and expunge from my record, which they had initially agreed to. Now I showed up to court and got my two tickets dismissed which I was innocent of from the beginning. A few days later they sent me an email, saying that if someone were to dig my record they would still show up unless they were expunged. So I called the Lawyer Megan and she said I had to pay around $800 more to have that expunction, which I had initially already paid and hired them for, I just can't believe I went through all this.",

This colleague unfortunately does not do ticket cases, but assured us that JBABB would take exceptional care of us which they absolutely did! My partner was extremely stressed over a citation he received and we were adamant about getting it dismissed. From the first phone-call, Brooklyn, the legal assistant, was incredibly educated about his legal matter & thorough when guiding him through what to expect & what steps he needed to take. Many attorney offices will simply throw out sales pitches while sugar coating the details, but Brooklyn offered realistic feedback while maintaining an optimistic outlook and approach. Poor communication or lack thereof is one of the most common frustrations when working with an attorney/attorney\u2019s office so we were beyond pleased when we received consistent, punctual, & concise communication from beginning to end with JBABB firm, & notably, Brooklyn G. When the day of the hearing came, we were met at the courthouse by Jason\u2019s associate, attorney Alan Perez. He had already executed some of the process on my partner\u2019s behalf before we arrived & informed him of what he was to expect & how to proceed to conclude the hearing. He was very professional and easy to engage with. We were relieved and grateful when my partner\u2019s ticket was dismissed!! Next step is working to get an expungement which he will certainly be using JBABB for as well. We are highly impressed & can confidently recommend this firm to anyone who needs someone to fight for them & with them!",

With the help of Gorelick Law Firm, they were able to get this expunged for me! I appreciate all of her hard work and the team around her! Highly recommend her and this law firm!

I talked to other lawyers about my case and they all said it couldn't be done but Jim Ball made me feel like I had a good chance.  When I was worried Jim and his staff set me at ease.  They were responsive to all my emails and calls.  Plus Jim is just a damn nice guy who was very articulate in court and helped the judge understand my case and got the whole thing sealed and expunged.  I was crying for half the day( I never cry) because he gave me my life back.  Please do yourself a favor and reach out to him and let him help you because he will give it his best and not make you feel stupid or uncomfortable.  Thank you for my life back Jim and keep on helping others like you did me.\n\nP.S. his staff was amazing also...thank you Ruby.",

He was able to defend my case well, and I only had to pay a fine and do a driving course online. I was very grateful. God is good, and I'm thankful for The Weiland Firm and for Nick Wright.",

This was my 1st time I was involved in a criminal matter and Mr. Dewey was assuaging but also realistic as well as an attorney should. Mr. Dewey was understanding that any settlement could be career-ending and knew that I could not settle for less! He called me every week on updating and went out of his way for even favors such as getting paperwork for my hospital and even forcing them to send an email confirming my lab results. Now I am able to practice. THANK YOU MAN! Will consult you again for arrest removal as well.",

They got one of my charges expunged, and the other knocked down to a non-moving violation. Hallye was very kind and responsive to any questions I had. She really helped me feel at ease about getting my first warrant, and I knew I was in good hands.

I've reached out multiple times, always getting one of his assistants explaining \" How they've been out with whatever different personal issue it is at the time, and trying to catch up\" or \"Joe's in court and will call you back.\" It has been a non-stop battle for the last 9 months and there's not even a case number filed yet. I have reached out multiple times to get my money back and shocker no response. I have tried calling multiple times and my phone won't even reach them anymore, and none of my emails are getting returned. I wish I didn't have to sit here and bad mouth them. He was a very nice guy, and I really just wanted my case to go as promised. I will gladly edit the review if I can get my case wrapped up. Unfortunately I will be reaching out to the bar association to see how to handle the situation further. I advise anybody else going through the same to do the same.",

After reading all the positive reviews about Spellman Law Firm, we decided to reach out to Sean Spellman. He responded immediately, and we met with him the same day. He worked tirelessly on our case for 8 months, keeping us updated every step of the way.  He was able to get all charges dismissed and the charges expunged from our son\u2019s record. Sean gave us hope when we were hopeless and treated us like we were a part of his family. You could feel his kindness and compassion from the first meeting. Sean Spellman totally changed the course of our son\u2019s life for the better. He is truly the best defense attorney out there. We feel blessed that God put this case in Sean Spellman\u2019s hands. He never gave up hope that he could help us. We will always appreciate everything he did for our family.",

They were determined to help me win my case. When Megan called me and let me know they would take my case that other lawyers  wanted so much money that I could not afford, I was so happy they took my case pro bono. I was referred to them by legal aid. Mr Scafiddi and Megan are the greatest lawyers in our country, they handled my case with professionalism, they treated me more like a friend than like a client. I felt so good knowing they were handling my case. Mr Scafiddi and Megan did so much work to prove by law I was eligible to have my case expunged. I'm so blessed and I thank my Lord Jesus for them in my life. I could say a thousand words to talk about how good they were and it still wouldn't be enough to say how good of lawyers they are and how much I appreciate them. I now have that second chance in life, Thank You Mr. Michael Scafiddi and  Megan Scafiddi...",

She was on top of the case from the very beginning and was so professional throughout the whole process. Her dedication to my case showed when even in the midst of dealing with personal grief, due to the passing of her mother, she never lost her ground and in a matter of six months got every single charge dismissed where the two previous attorneys only attempted to have me take a plea deal. I highly recommend Attorney Monez because her fine work allowed me to keep my clean record and avoid deportation. Really, no words can express how grateful I am for having an excellent attorney go above and beyond for my cause. With her you\u2019re not just a dollar sign, she sees the person, the human being and our vulnerability when we face the system. I would trust no other attorney in the Modesto area for complicated cases that could put a life at risk.\n\nOnce again Attorney Rebecka A. MONEZ thank you for your help.\n\nSincerely:\nCosme Eduardo Gil \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

I had hired Garret over 10 years ago to help get an expungement on my case in which I received a successful outcome in doing so. I knew when my husband was presently going through his own criminal matter that it was time again to give a call to Garret and get that promising result I personally got 10 years ago. I am so glad to have made that choice twice to hire him. No regrets at all as he is a bold and proficient individual. He gave the comfort and peace of mind to my husband that nobody can give as he made sure he got a good outcome from his criminal case. If you are looking for a lawyer that does not bs and gives you results that you need and doesn\u2019t try to scam you for just money hire Garret!",

Oh and as a FYI there is another person here same thing they need more information they need to come back. I had prematurely recommended them to a friend of mine and they took his money never got back to him and he had a higher whole nother lawyer to do his expungement and they still have it pending on their desk .Don't wast your money or time on this office they don't care about anything but the money...\nUpdate none of his employees do their job David Wallin will not contact you he doesn't have anything to do with it he just takes your money pushes it off I have literally paid these people over $10,000 and now I'm doing all the work because they keep promising me they submitted the paperwork to the court the DEA finally reach out to me said nothing was submitted they won't return phone calls that the da personally apologized to me that I even wasted my money with this company just be very aware if you do business with them.\nI'm actually going to make a complaint on the California State Bar site against them",

Mr. Brady may be a little more expensive than other lawyers, but he gave us good results.  He is a member of the good ol' boy system -- something you want in a defense lawyer.\n\nWe just did business with him again very recently, and had all charges dismissed.  (Traffic offenses)",

          "text": "If you\u2019re looking for a top notch attorney to represent you for DWI, look no further! I speak from experience when I can confidently say that Fiandach & Fiandach is by far the very best you\u2019ll find. A highly professional firm who really cares about their clients, rest assured that they will fight to get your charges dropped or win you a lesser charge.\n\nIn early 2019 I made a big mistake & drove home after drinking ~6 IPAs at a concert. I was pulled over & arrested after failing the sobriety tests I was given by a Monroe County Sheriff. After being arrested I was brought back to the station where I blew a .15 into a DataMaster, almost twice the legal limit, just short of an aggravated DWI.\n\nAfter much research about who to call, I came across great reviews for Fiandach. I called the firm to ask some questions & got in touch with Sue, who was very caring & gave me all the information I needed to know. She organized a time for me to meet in person with Ed Fiandach for a consultation. After describing the details of my arrest & charges with Ed in person, I had a feeling of relief based off his professional responses & confidence in his ability to take my case to trial & get my charges reduced to a DWAI. This would be a huge win for me, I instantly knew I was in good hands.\n\nI was fortunate enough to retain Ed himself as my representation & it was like an enormous weight had been lifted off my shoulders.\n\nUpon my arraignment, I was concerned I would have to give up my license until I stood trial. Ed was prepared with paperwork to fight for me to get a hardship license, though he was confident we wouldn\u2019t even need it. I couldn\u2019t believe it when the judge allowed me to keep my license throughout the entire 8 month time frame leading up to my trial without the need for any hardship paperwork. I could tell the judge had a high level of respect for Ed Fiandach which in turn allowed me this privilege, again realizing I was in good hands.\n\nEd & his firm put together a strong litany of detailed documents making the prosecutor work hard to produce many points of evidence to comply for discovery. Honestly, if I were a prosecutor, I really wouldn\u2019t want to be up against a defendant who is shielded by Fiandach & his brilliant team. These documents really made the prosecutor work hard to produce their supporting documentation, & I sensed just by looking at his body language & mannerisms that the prosecutor was very annoyed at the amount of work he would have to do for my case!\n\n8 months later, my trial was held. I was especially nervous when I noticed there was an entire Criminal Justice class from a local college sitting in watching & taking notes. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, I thought for sure after blowing a .15 I would definitely be nailed with a DWI, marking my squeaky clean record with a nasty criminal stain. I worried about my future job prospects, my car insurance, needing an interlock installed, a smorgasbord of fines, and everything else that goes along with getting a DWI sentence.\n\nEd felt right at home in the courtroom, his years of experience shows. He listened to every word the prosecutor said & spoke out several times to force him to move on to the next sentence, & give up on defaming my good character. Each time Ed gave the judge a detailed explanation for why the prosecutor should refrain from mischaracterizing the details. Ed did an outstanding job cross-examining the Sheriff in front of the judge, painting a picture for the court which showed me in a positive light.\n\nI was so happy when the judge came to his decision to lower my DWI to a DWAI! Ed Fiandach is truly a magician in the courtroom. He got the outcome I so dearly wanted & now my record remains clear of any criminal convictions! I\u2019ve signed up for the NYS IDP program so I\u2019ll never even have to experience not being able to drive, I get a conditional, it\u2019s all I need.\n\nIt was worth every cent. If you\u2019re serious, I highly recommend this firm.",

First, he managed to get the charge reduced to a wet reckless, and now, it\u2019s officially expunged just after 4 years.\n\nWhen I look back at my younger years, I realize how reckless I was. Now, I\u2019ve grown. I have a wife, a family, and a clearer sense of what really matters. I\u2019ve learned not to make foolish decisions anymore.\n\nThank you, Levon, for standing by me all these years. You\u2019ve not only been my lawyer but a true friend. That said, Better Call Saul!",

          "text": "3 months after hiring Nghi all 14 misdemeanors on my record were expunged! You\u2019re probably thinking 14 misdemeanors??? Yes, that was my record for a long time after an 8 year battle with heavy drug addiction that left my criminal record battered with a troubled past. After cleaning up my life those charges still loomed over me, I was unable to get the job I wanted and it made me doubt myself knowing they were there even though I completely turned around my life.  So I finally decided to do something about it after almost 7 years of sobriety and tired of not having the career I want. Initially I attempted to do the expungement process myself but quickly realized all the forms and procedures were completely foreign to me and didn\u2019t want to draw this out any further.  That\u2019s when I looked up a Criminal lawyer and met Nghi who is so nice, friendly and Kind hearted person. He explained the process thoroughly and got everything done so quick!! My cases were a little complicated, I had 5 cases out of 4 different court house that made up all those misdemeanors. He was able to go to each one individually for me, I didn\u2019t have to miss any work, or appear at any court dates. He even was able to get one case dismissed that still had unpaid probation fees that I wasn\u2019t quite able to pay off before starting this process . He\u2019s definitely a talented and amazing lawyer and I\u2019m thankful to have him in my corner god forbid I ever have a brush with the law again.",

          "text": "Would recommend seeking other attorneys. The only time they were really attentive is the initial consultation when they are getting ready to ask for money as a retainer. After that my defense attorney was a lay down and was easily pushed around by the opposing counsel. He seemed to be well known, but certainly did not have enough clout to get good results for me. I was 42 years old at the time with a clean record , a veteran, and had NEVER been in any trouble before. I was charged with Felony Assault.  Not only did I end up with the felony, but from day he never got an inch from the other attorney and kept telling me how it was the best we could do. I believe many other attorneys could have had the charge reduced and I likely would have ended up with a misdemeanor.  At one point I had to call and email my attorney no less than 6 times over a 2 week period with no response. I had to complain to another attorney at the firm to get a response. My attorney continued to tell me what he would do, but NEVER followed through without repeated requests or follow up on my part. Very non-responsive and maybe they just take too many clients at once. On top of that, he knew I was a veteran and didn't even tell me I could have been eligible to be tried or have my case go through the veterans courts. I likely would not have even had a felony. I made the mistake that got me in trouble, no doubt about that, but the other mistake I made was trusting this firm to represent me. Your money would be better spent elsewhere. Also, used the family division of this firm through a divorce. Had to fire them and hire a different firm which made the attention I was getting from Jason at WMDT look like a joke. I got farther and more answers from MI Family Law Center in a few days than this firm got me in 2 months. Thank goodness I switched! I plan to have my felony expunged when I can. I will not use this firm for that unless they offer to do it free for doing such a poor job TWICE.",

I can't begin to describe the relief we felt once we started to see Mark Hunting in action trying to get the best possible outcome for us.  He never gave us unrealistic hopes, and he thoroughly and carefully explained our options. Most importantly, he was always there for us and answered every question, sometimes on weekends. He explained all aspects for clearing our reputation on the web, and was able to get everything expunged. He is absolutely the best in our opinion.",

The moment I signed with them, a weight lifted off my shoulders because I knew I was in good hands and that they would take care of everything, and they did! I felt that they truly cared about me as an individual. Lane was awesome and kept me informed every step of the way. He always answered my messages promptly and reassured me that everything was going to be ok. Scott was also great and fought for me until the very end. Victoria was great too and was always able to quickly get me an appointment when needed. There were others whose names I don\u2019t remember who also helped. The entire team was amazing!! Thank you so much!! I will forever be grateful!! I\u2019m so glad that I found them through these reviews and want to pay it forward to others looking for an attorney. These guys truly are the best!

After reading Susanne 's internet listing I contacted her and requested her representation for him. She agreed to do so.\nHis case is settled now; the judge ruled for a time of probation, with expungement following successful completion of the probation, and a couple other requirements.\nI am delighted with the representation we received from Suzanne. She has integrity, skill, compassion, and exceeded our hopes for his case. She is very capable.\nI can highly recommend Susanne without any reservation or hesitation for anyone needing a criminal defense attorney.\nThank you, Susanne!",

Yes, I paid fines and classes, but these were minimal in comparison to what others have experienced.\n\nJump forward 2 years. Surprise, surprise, I have a warrant for the above charges. The person that was supposed to close my case at AP&P quit, and my case did not get closed complete as it should have been. I called Susanne and she immediately took my case to the courts for dismissal, which it was. The courts were putting me off until the end of the month. I have a background check requirement for a new job. They aren't going to hire someone with an open warrant.\n\nSusanne continues to impress me, worth the money. (She is not the cheapest, just the best.) We are going to work to have these charges expunge in June. I know Susanne will get it done. She know the laws, and she understands the Utah criminal system and courts inside and out.",

In my opinion, believing and seeing that you have hired competent counsel that represents your best interests, in every avenue and turn that a case may take, is imperative.  These qualities were well-shown to me by Smoland Law, specifically by Taylor Goldstein.  She helped me win a petition to gain relief from consequences of a case from the distant past, and mitigate the constant threat of felony it continued to present.  She has a ton of experience in expungements, as well as other areas.  I refer to her as the best lawyer in town.  I would like to give 8, 9, or even 10 stars, but the max is 5.",

Understanding the pursuit would be a very long and trying process, I must say, I look back now with a perfectly clean record, fully realizing it would not have been possible without the patience, intelligence, and undying endurance of SMOLAND LAW.\n\nI will be forever grateful (and emotionally indebted) that I came into the guidance and legal support of first-rate counselors like Dain Smoland and Taylor Goldstein. These two are rare and wonderful humans who make miracles happens, while letting their humble but brilliant actions do the talking.\n\nGame Changers and Dream Makers, truly!",

He is hands down the best attorney in the state, intelligent, knows the law like the back of his hand, and most importantly, has a big heart and cares about his clients. He also represents indigent clients from my nonprofit, the Nomad Alliance, all chronically unsheltered individuals who could never dream of having a private criminal defense attorney. He helps expunge and reduce their records via Kayak and Homeless Court, sans any pay, but simply because he believes every person has the right to quality representation and a new start in life. Best attorney ever! Highly recommend!",

This will profoundly change my life and career opportunities.\n\nHer assistant Garrison was also very helpful and informative.\n\nShe also uses a communication website where you can upload and receive documentation, and send messages to her and Garrison.

Today Jesse represented me in my court hearing and it went beautifully. He made me feel so at ease just before we went in the court room. He said I just know it would get expunged and I haven\u2019t lost a case yet ! The prosecutor made a ok case but Jesse\u2019s was much better!! So today the judge granted me an expungement of my record. I am so beyond thrilled and cannot thank Garrison and Jesse enough.

          "text": "I had always been under the impression that criminal defense attorney's were of questionable character, that they helped unseemly types evade justice. But then I had an overzealous detective (from Holladay, UT) cite me for a criminal offense that I simply did not commit. I can't fully express how disappointing it was to discover first-hand that police aren't always interested in facts, fairness or justice. This \"detective\" wasn't keen on actually doing any detecting at all. He just made a judgement off the cuff and didn't care about the consequences for the people his sloppy decisions impacted. When I questioned him, he even acted like he was doing me a favor by only charging me with one offense. The arrogance and ineptitude was astounding. But either way, I suddenly found myself in need of a good criminal defense attorney.\n\nA personal friend in the community recommended Jesse Nix, saying that he was a top-shelf attorney, kind, compassionate, and an all-around great person. I knew that he was exactly who I was looking for from our very first conversation. I had already been hounded by several criminal defense firms who proverbially chase the local paddy wagon for \"criminal\" clients, but Jesse was nothing like them. Jesse never asked me to hire him at all. In fact, for our first few conversations, he just wanted to listen, answer my questions, and give me some free advice on what options I could expect from the prosecutor's office moving forward. As a person who had never before been the target of police, much less received a criminal citation, Jesse was exactly the calm, insightful advocate I needed in an otherwise exceptionally stressful situation.\n\nSo I asked him to represent me and he did a phenomenal job. Throughout the process he never made me feel like I was wasting his time. He was patient with my questions, apprehensions and general twitchiness, and he always returned my calls and emails in a timely fashion. But most importantly, he relentlessly pursued the prosecutor assigned to the case and was able to get him to see that I simply didn't do what I was accused of and that the prosecution would lose if my case went to trial. He was convincing and my case was dismissed. Jesse then represented me in the subsequent civil case (which was also resolved favorably), and then he helped me navigate the expungement process so that my clean record remains as such.\n\nSimply put, Jesse was absolutely outstanding. I'm sure that there are other quality criminal defense lawyers out there, but I wouldn't trust my legal life to anyone but Jesse Nix and his team. You cannot go wrong here; he is worth every cent. Hopefully I will never need to hire an attorney again, but if I do, I would hire Jesse Nix in heartbeat. He's the one you want on your side. He really is that good. Thank you, Jesse and Garrison!",

He is well liked and known by his colleagues in the court system, which gives him an edge over other attorneys. Max is straightforward, easy to work with, and very good at what he does. He was able to get me the best possible outcome in a timely manner, as well as set a future plan to have my record cleared. I would highly recommend Max, and I am glad that I made the right choice!",

Max's dedication and relentless attention to my case was exceptional. He answered all my questions and provided case studies that backed his answers. His knowledge and experience makes him a master working the legal system. He knew the possible pitfalls and navigated them with complete confidence. He kept me informed through the entire process. The outcome was beyond anything I expected! The charges were dropped and my record expunged.\nIf you find yourself on the other side of the law, Max should be your first call. Max\u2019s continuous communication, professionalism, representation and dedication to my case should be a standard that all other attorneys be compared.",

All available and pretty good at getting back to you quickly. Tom and Reid worked as a great team to combat the horrible ordeal I had to go through. If you are a husband who has been wronged by your exwife, Tom is the guy you want! He has great connections and a great work ethic! Ben even got the charged expunged! Very highly recommend!!!",

          "text": "Hello, my name is Tyler and I have received more help than I could ask for from Malek's Law Firm over the last several months. If I had one thing to say about Linda Malek's Law Firm and team you will NOT be failed or disappointed. Linda and her team are workaholics and incredibly smart. They all pay very close attention to detail, and dig deep into laws and all facts. In March of 2022, Ohio passed Senate Bill 215 (Constitutional Carry) and around the same time I purchased a new handgun and holster for conceal carry. I did not have a CCW or a permit and I was under the assumption the bill takes immediate effect. Two days after the purchase, I was driving home while carrying my new firearm in my holster and was pulled over by a Cuyahoga Falls Police Officer for a head light that was out. As soon as the officer approached me, he said my headlight was completely out and immediately I informed him I had a firearm on me. He asked me why I had a firearm without a CCW or a permit. I told him because Constitutional Carry just passed. He informed me the bill doesn't go into effect until June 13th 2022, then laughs. When the second unit arrived on scene, the officer confiscates my firearm then they cuffed me and stuffed me into the cruiser. They booked me in Cuyahoga Falls jail and charged me with two felonies and a misdemeanor: Improper Handling Of A Firearm in a motor vehicle, Carrying Concealed Weapon, and Lighted Lights. I spent the night in the clink behind bars. Fortunately for me, I got in contact with Linda Malek's Law Firm shortly after and was in good hands. After the body cam and dash cam came back, turns out I never had a headlight out and the phony officer had made several bold lies. I was mistaken for Senate Bill 215 not taking effect immediately, but was wrongfully stopped without probable cause by Cuyahoga Falls Police. Linda Malek and her team worked extremely hard on this case. After six months and several court dates, Linda Malek and her team had beat this case and got both of my felonies completely dismissed. Also my firearm has been returned and I got everything immediately expunged. I can not thank the Malek Law Firm enough for all the hard work they've done for me which has set me up for a happy and successful future.",

(I was a hopeless drug addict who has since paid all my dues to society, started businesses, outreaches, ministries, and am now living as a missionary. I truly am not the same person I was)  T. Scott Jones was able to work with the DA and the judge on my behalf and get my ENTIRE RECORD expunged. I have since had every right of citizenship restored including 2A and voting rights as a result of his hard work and tenacity. He strived to always be available for me and when he wasn't, his assistant was always able to get me the answers I needed the same day, usually within the hour. I cannot imagine that there is another attorney that would even be willing to take on this task, nevermind actually get it done.It is my honor to talk to everyone about my story so that they can get help to get their record restored and I absolutely could not have done it without the help of this firm and specifically Mr. T. Scott Jones. He is a man of integrity and if he says he's going to do something, you bet your bottom dollar, it's as good as done. Thank you T. Scott Jones for all that you have done for me and my family! Sincerely, a restored and renewed husband, father, and proud Citizen of these beautiful United States of America.",

Anthony Salerno came highly recommended by a close friend in law enforcement in Worcester County. Attorney Salerno was highly regarded as one of the best criminal defense attorneys around. I contacted his office through the website at 9PM on a federal holiday expecting to hear back during normal business hours but he called me back at 11PM knowing that my arraignment was the next morning. He explained the initial arraignment proceedings and asked to set up a meeting in his office to discuss my case. This proved to me that Attorney Salerno\u2019s dedication to his clients was second to none! After meeting with Attorney Salerno, there was no question that he was definitely the right choice for me. Throughout an almost year long process, Attorney Salerno kept me informed, was honest and reassured that he would do everything he possibly could to get me the best possible outcome in my case. I can say with certainty that he went above and beyond to exceed my expectations. During the trial, he was able to utilize his skill, experience and legal knowledge to obtain a NOT GUILTY verdict. If you are ever in need of a best in class criminal defense attorney, look no further. Attorney Salerno is your man!",

And I was given probation without it being on my record. So that being said this is how Gracia Law Firm represented me and I'm GRATEFUL that this won't be on my record. All I have to do is comply with my probation officer to have a clean record again.\nSo if you need a good law firm. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Gracia Law Firm.",

He had both dropped to simple misdemeanors, no conviction and no gulity plea. Was looking at years in prison, he got that thrown out and recevied a few months simple probation, and can expunge/seal after words.

He helped me get enrolled into a PTI program which he followed up with me frequently to make sure I was doing the necessary steps to complete the program . After 1 year of the PTI program me and Dave went to court and received confirmation from the judge that I officially completed the program and the case will not count against me . Currently we are in the process of completely expunging the charge of my record and he has been very helpful with that also . I sincerely recommend Dave to anyone who is looking for a good attorney that will be with you throughout every step of the way and is a professional and kind person .",

I explained to Ken that I heard two different versions of this audio. I didn\u2019t know the terminology then, but I told him exculpatory evidence had been removed.\nKen refused to speak to the forensic specialist, or allow him to do a final forensic report. Two years, and multiple requests both verbally and via email were ignored.\nWhile constantly reminding me of the jeopardy I was in, and that a felony conviction with a one year probation was possible; he repeatedly tried to convince me that I was \u201cmistaken\u201d about the audio evidence.\nI was forced to hire another attorney to get the audio analyzed and to hire a private investigator which Ken also refused to do.\nI went ahead and hired the forensic expert that wrote the preliminary report I gave Ken. Ken disappeared. He didn\u2019t attend a conference call to discuss the forensic report. Co council said he wasn\u2019t returning calls. He didn\u2019t return my calls or respond to my emails.\nFast forward, without Ken, a motion was filed and a judge threw out the recorded evidence after the same forensic expert that Ken ignored, demonstrated that 15 seconds of conversation were missing and portions of remaining conversations were now blank.\nThe judge then dismissed the felony charge. He then gave me a withheld of adjudication on the misdemeanor. No jail, no probation, and a sealed record.\nIf I did not hire additional attorneys to do Ken Padowitz job, there would have been no Forensic report, and I would have eventually been forced to accept a plea deal which would have resulted in a felony conviction.",

I was devastated. My husband had east ridge police and animal control charge me with 2 counts of animal cruelty, because 1 of his feeder rats had died.... I absolutely LOVE animals. It was all in retaliation to me finally able to leave the relationship. Because of this I spent 9 hours in silverdale, booked and fingerprinted and it was absolutely humiliating to say the least. I contacted Stevie, at the office next to Phills, she is getting ready to have a baby and referred me to Best and Brock. Things have not been good since I left the relationship,  my ex got the house and all the animals but 1. Due to me losing my job due to the charges. As soon as Phil got to the courthouse he assured me that everything was going to be OK! And let me tell you, I felt at ease with him. Not only did he talk to the DA multiple times on my behalf,  but he got the case completely dismissed and my charges will be expunged entirely! Phil is also going to write a letter to my employer, in order for me to hopefully get my job back. Phil completely exceeded every expectation I had. I cannot thank him enough! Thank you so much Phil and Best and Brock! U litterly made it to where I can finally breathe again! And now I can move on with my life, and start putting the pieces if mine and my daughters life back together. I could not be more grateful! Thank you for being such a blessing to me and my daughter! Pic of me and my daughter and my dog Beatrix. Because of Phil,  we can now build a brand new life together!",

She was referred to us after my 1st attorney told me I'd need a more experienced criminal attorney to continue. I had been wrongfully accused of a crime and what I was lead to believe was a pretty simple situation to resolve, instead just kept spiraling into a bigger mess. At our first meeting with Meredith I knew I was in good hands. She took as much time as we needed to explain the process to my wife and I, and gave wise counsel as how to proceed. She is compassionate yet straightforward and clear. She was very responsive anytime I texted or called. Best yet, my case was dismissed and record is being expunged. This nightmare is finally over. If ever someone I care about finds themselves in trouble and needing help through a difficult legal situation, she is the only attorney I will recommend. I hope to never need her again, but I'm very comforted to know that if I did, I'd be in very capable hands.",

A civil case was later added to the mix. I felt overwhelmed and It seemed like I was dumping a really big mess in her lap for her to have to sift through. She was unfazed. She was very knowledgeable and experienced. I knew five minutes into the consultation with her that there was no way in the world I could walk out of her office and not retain her. More than once along the way there was a real danger of incarceration and other punitive actions. Meredith was confident, able, and fearless. She is a warrior. She is certain. She is not a quitter. She probably would be successful as a women's MMA cage fighter. I could see as she interacted with other attorneys that they knew who she was and had a healthy level of respect, fear, and admiration for her. Several things I particularly enjoyed about Meredith was her humility in regards to herself, the empathy she showed for my situation, and how respectful she was to me and towards others. I retained Meredith for three different cases. It was a nightmare. But by the time she was through, all three cases were dismissed and I walked away with a clean record and a heavy load lifted off my shoulders.",

I don't really believe he actually tried. I think he just wanted the other half of the money. Even after I couldn't come up with the other $3500.00, instead of working with me through the next court date he wanted me to postpone it in order to get the rest of the money, however, I said no and went to the court myself without representation and guess what after actually speaking with the DA myself, the case was dismissed and expunged. Saved $3500.00!!! Conclusion: when you go looking for an Attorney with a fancy office, fancy website, expect a fancy price and not that much bang for your buck.",

After meeting with Mr. Johnny Houston, I immediately felt better and reassured about my situation. He was compassionate, affable & knowledgeable about my case & was confident he could minimize the legal ramifications I could be facing. He answered many questions from myself, as well as my concerned family. He made himself very available to me during the pre-court date phase.\n\nOn the day of court, he met me & had already made arrangements to bring a very positive outcome to my case (conditional dismissal). He stood by me when I approached the judge & did everything in his power to minimize all penalties, including getting me out of paying expensive court costs. My family & myself were very pleased with the outcome.\n\nAfter the court date, he continued to be supportive & promptly filed the paperwork to get my case dismissed & expunged. He supplied me with documents needed to help me in my employment search.\n\nThe staff of Houston & Alexander were also wonderful & of great assistance during this trying time. The paralegals were knowledgeable & quickly answered questions & submitted documents & files to the my case online portal.\n\nI highly recommend the Houston Alexander law firm to anyone facing a legal situation. They will represent you with care, compassion & the utmost professionalism. They are definitely among the top legal firms in the Chattanooga, TN area.\n\nThank you again to Johnny & the entire Houston Alexander team!",

This wouldn't be a big deal, but he had a previous charge elsewhere, so it made him look like a troublemaker on paper. I was really concerned about having violent charges on his record, but  Bret stepped in and solved his issues on all of his charges within the next court date. It was mind blowing how much he truly cared about Austin\u2019s record and didn\u2019t just take the easy way out. In the process, he was able to have a charge against me dropped as well.  He even helped with having my charge expunged from my record.  I'm beyond thankful to have Bret and his team on our side. This is the only firm I\u2019d recommend to a friend or loved one.",

I only attended one court date Tom took care of the rest! I spoke to a couple of lawyers but after speaking with Tom I knew I was choosing the right lawyer! Trust me when I tell you this is a lawyer who will not just take your money and lie to you and run you through the ringer!

He responded in an extremely timely manner, not only was he very knowledgeable and patient with me, he was very compassionate, and sincerely understanding when I told him what I was going through at the time. He was professional, upfront, reassuring, and articulate. Thomas was effective in offering how he could help as my attorney, even taking the time to explain the steps in detail and the action needed to help me with my case. He continuously stayed in touch with updates. Also answering all my questions making it easier, as well as calming me down and giving me peace of mind in a stressful, but successful outcome. Not only did he get my misdemeanor dismissed and expunged off my record. I also was sentenced to do community service, but due to the fact I was going though some family problems and caught COVID at the time, he was able to get me out of the hours completely. I will forever be grateful for Thomas Thomasian representing me. Thomas is an exceptional attorney who changed my life. There is no other attorney that will work as hard for you and keep his word. I highly recommend Thomas Thomasian as your defense attorney, you won\u2019t be disappointed. I could not have been happier with the outcome and can\u2019t thank him enough!",

          "text": "I am writing this so that my experience with Tom can be known.  I was in a very difficult legal situation.  I was looking at my 4th D.U.I. This was a very difficult experience  for myself and loved one's .  I potentially was looking at serious jail time as well as my license possibly being revoked for life.  I am in my 40's, my life is very well put together, great job, place to live, great family and friends and my health. The possible consequences of my actions would have drastically changed my life and the lives around me.\nMy case was very difficult as this case involved myself being arrested for a  D.U.I in Rhode Island but my driver's license is from Florida. Not good to say the least. Again I was facing a 4th D.U.I. as I have 3 in the state of Florida.\nHere is where Tom comes in.  Tom was recommended to me from a family/friend lawyer.  Tom came very highly regarded.  As a former state prosecutor he defiantly knows how the prosecutors act, think and his great reputation  is very obviously known in the courtroom .  Tom built a great client/lawyer relationship with me based on trust.  There were times in my case when I wasn't so sure if I had the best person representing myself, not only did I have the right person but I had the best lawyer. I had both, Tom the person and the lawyer.\nMy case as noted was extremely difficult, this wasn't the ordinary D.U.I, being it was my 4th and out of state. Tom worked within the legal system and was able to provide me with a hardship license to and from work.  I remember the D.A. in the courtroom denying me of this at first.  When Tom and I returned I in fact was granted this hardship license . I remember very well that I was told, \"It's against my better judgement to grant you this, you should be thanking your lawyer for his competency \". I knew right then that I had the wisest person in the courtroom representing me.  Afterwards Tom met my family member outside of the courtroom , she was relieved with the ruling, he was very kind and genuine towards her.\nMoving forward with Tom's expertise, effort and knowledge  I was able to drive to and from work.  I still had the D.U.I to contend with and if convicted , well off to jail I would go and life as I know it to be would have drastically  altered.\nTom once again found the police to have pulled me over without just cause. He and I were prepared to take this to court after my pretrial.  We had to wait for the state of Florida to collaborate with the state of Rhode Island. Tom was supportive, constantly working with me and my case during this time.  He always stayed in good communication, always did what he said he would do, and made me feel like there was a chance, there was reason to believe that my consequence's of my actions would be minimal .\nIn the end my D.U.I case was dropped by the state of Florida and Rhode Island.  I have community service and a alcohol class to attend . Meanwhile I am still able to drive to and from work.   Tom is also getting my charges expunged.  This is all very doable compared to the other very realistic possible set of circumstances that I could be in.\nI write about my experience to share with other's . I write this because I want to thank Tom for all he accomplished for myself and family.  I think back to the times I had with all the unknowns in my life.  One thing I always knew was I had the right, best and trustworthy person by my side through this all. I obviously suggest that you don't make poor choices for yourself and don't have to deal with what I have.  If you are reading this you may have.  I strongly recommend , not suggest that you have Tom Thomasian as your lawyer. Tom, thank you!\n\nSergio",

My boyfriend and I found ourselves in a situation where we needed a lawyer and were not sure where to start as neither of us have ever been in trouble. I remembered seeing an ad for AVVO so I decided to look on there. We knew it would be a somewhat easy case, but I am a worry wart so I didnt want to just pick some Joe Schmo. I sorted the website to see who had the highest AVVO rating and the highest reviews and that is how I found Tom Thomasian. I read all of the reviews and everyone seemed to be very pleased with his services and I saw that he offered a free consultation so I figured it wouldnt hurt to just meet with him and see what he thought. I called Tom's office and I expected to just set up an appointment with a secretary, I left my name and number and about 5 minutes later Tom called me himself to set up the appointment. I told him our situation and he seemed confident that he would be able to help us out. A few days later we met him at his office and after meeting with him and going over what he could do for us, I knew he was the right person to hire. Now don't get me wrong, he isnt the cheapest attorney, but you get what you pay for. Do you really want to cut coupons for a lawyer? I dont, I would rather pay good money and feel confident walking into court with someone who I know has our back. Tom was always there to answer any questions we had, whether I called him or sent him a text message. We went to court three times, each time we were there for 10 minutes max. In the end our case was dismissed and we had it expunged. Hopefully I will never have to hire Tom again, but I will always keep his card in my wallet because if anyone ever needs help he is the person I will send them to. If you are looking for a lawyer and you are scared and have no idea what to expect (like I was) he is the best lawyer to have because he will talk you through each step of the process and make sure that you are comfortable with what is going on with your case.",

I felt that I was able to make informed decisions and go in to court feeling confident. John successfully advocated for reduced charges against me with minimal to no impact on my life, allowing me to move forward. He was detailed in his work and found critical errors such as violation of my rights. John was also able to favorably resolve a violation of the previous case because of the second new charge. Additionally, Attorney Grasso offers services to permanently seal records for cases (when applicable) that I look forward to using when I am eligible. I would highly recommend Attorney John Grasso to anyone who is facing criminal charges and wants a honest, hardworking, detailed attorney who truly advocates for their client.",

Even with objections from my ex wife, Casey and Gretchen gave me the validation and support needed in my situation to go through the court process and come out with a clear slate. They have ensured all the work I\u2019ve put in to better my life wasn\u2019t fruitless, and I can now finally pass background checks for housing, better jobs, etc. Casey and his team were the most genuine and honest people I\u2019ve met in a legal setting, and I could not be more lucky to have had them represent and guide me. They deserve so much more recognition and support, will definitely be reaching out to them again in the future!",

I had been assigned a public defender and was being forced into taking a plea without ANY work being done looking into my case. I called Casey Baxter and he immediately told me that I had a leg to stand on. He listened to every detail and was down to earth. They had my case thoroughly investigated, and made sense of. Sometimes police don\u2019t always have every detail. Casey Baxter was able to have my case dismissed with the state as well as offering expungement services at more than a fair price. If you\u2019re currently working with a public defender, DROP THEM and hire these guys. It is worth every pennie. Thank you again Casey Baxter.",

I called Baxter Harder and talked to Kerri right away. She explained every situation and time frames that could possibly happen with the expungement. As the process started from start to finish Kerri and Casey had outstanding communication with me as I was out of state. Every time Kerri got information I was informed via email or phone. This was a stressful time as i was on a deadline for this possible job. Kerri was very patient with me and listened when I was in concern. In the end Kerri and Casey executed my expungement on time as I was able to get hired for the job I wanted. I recommend Baxter Harder for any law experiences that you may encounter.

My final court date, Peter got the court to dismiss all charges against me and the record sealed, he took time to sit with my wife and I to explain everything.  His staff is top notch, Erica always answered my calls and questions, and quick to respond to emails.  I strongly recommend Peter and his office with the strongest confidence in their ability to help you!",

However I hit another driver in the process (on the freeway mind you) totally wrecked his car and also injured the lone passenger. It was really scary, and automatically I was going to be convicted with a DUI Felony. I was absolutely terrified because I had a clean record and now I was going to get a Felony! That's a stain that pretty much never can be expunged off your record. So I did my research and contacted around 8 different attorneys/legal firms in the San Diego County area. Some of them dealt specifically with DUI's others did a variety of legal practices. I found Peter Liss online through another attorney, who referred Mr. Liss to me. Boy did he come through for me! I didn't have to serve any extra jail time, I ended up with a DUI Misdemeanor which is essentially a slap on the wrist and only 3 months of OHS classes as rehabilitation. He also was diligent enough to get my fines reduced, not to mention he was very flexible as far as the cost. It wasn't an arm an a leg to retain him, and any time I needed him he was there (un-like the public defender I was assigned)",

Dod assigned Luis to me and he is THE BEST. He made everything so easy. He set up my DMV hearing, he told me what I needed to do to help my case. My BAC level was a .212 and he negotiated and got it down to a .19. So instead of the 9 month program, I just had to do the 3 month and no Ignition Interlock Device, Probation is just 3 years and I can expunge it after 2. And in court we asked the judge to reduce the DUI fine. So now I only have to pay $200 instead of $2000. This is the best outcome ever. Luis is the best. I didn't worry about my case for 2 months it was so easy. If you\u2019re looking for a knowledgeable, skilled, caring lawyer. Hire DOD Law.",

Justin NEVER displayed these qualities. He was only ever professional, FRIENDLY, and simply provided us with the legal advice we needed. That\u2019s all we ask, am I right? No judgements, just advice, and ACTION.\n\nDo yourself a favor, call Justin, and move towards leaving your past behind you.",

I consulted with the senior partner of a law firm and signed a contract, thinking that this attorney would represent me.  Much to my chagrin, after submitting payment for services, they pulled a bait and switch on me and assigned two rookies with less than two years of experience to represent me.  I knew after the first court appearance that this was not going to work, since the prosecutor was very aggressive.  A colleague at work and another lawyer highly recommended Mr. McCoppin to me because of his background as a prosecutor and his expertise with difficult cases.  I was convicted in district court, but we appealed.  Mr. McCoppin worked with the new prosecutors and successfully got my case dismissed, without having to go to trial.  My case was difficult because we couldn\u2019t prove that the witness was not being truthful.  I couldn\u2019t be happier with the outcome.  We are now working on getting my record expunged.  I highly recommend this attorney.  He knows what he is doing.",

I went from facing a possible six years in prison to Veterans Treatment Court. At the completion of VTC I did no jail time, no probation and all charges were dismissed and expunged. He really cares about the veteran community and helping veterans.",

Mr. Roberts was extremely communicative and transparent about where we were in the process. He was honest about any set backs encountered and remained diligent to meet those with resistance.\n\nLong story short, I was convicted of a non-violent felony in KS back in 2015 and since then I have been granted an expungement in 2020. I did my research and found each state handles restoration of gun rights differently. I recently moved back home to Missouri from Colorado and reached out to Twibell Pierson Criminal Law about my case. I spoke with Mr. Roberts and after a full debrief he was confident about doing everything he could to restore my federal gun rights.\n\nAfter a few months of back and forth with an appeal we received an approval letter in the mail from the FBI.\n\nI cannot thank Cole Roberts enough for restoring my federal gun rights!",

David was the ONLY attorney who explained everything to us, was interested in our details and made us feel comfortable.\n\nMy son was in a very bad situation and it was only going to get worse. As soon as we hired David he went to work for us. He was always available to us, replied right away and always kept us updated.\n\nHe believed in our son, was by him every step and in the end my son was able to breathe. No charges filed and his clean record in tact.\n\nAs far as rates, David was very reasonable compared to others in the area. He doesn\u2019t just go off charges like everyone else. He gathers facts and possible outcomes to help determine his rates.\n\nI hope we will never need his services again but if we do or if anyone we come across ever does, David would be the first call.\n\nIf you are lost and looking for an attorney who will treat you as their only client and not just another file. I\u2019m telling you now, David is your guy.",

I explained the circumstances surrounding my case and I felt like I didn\u2019t give him much to work with and handed him a complicated case, but he accepted the challenge. Two months into the case I was diagnosed with cancer. Before court David and I mostly talked about my diagnosis, he was both personable and encouraging. Upon entering the courtroom, he talked with the officer but she would not waiver. He told me to concentrate on my treatment. Five months later the case against me was dismissed, and two months after that he won the DMV hearing. Now I focus strictly on my health. When David was deciding on a career path, I\u2019m so grateful he found his calling and became a lawyer.\n\nA couple years ago I had a run in with the law and afterwards I was solicited by mail from numerous lawyers. I conducted my own search and compiled a list of four lawyers. After speaking with three I felt hopeless and overwhelmed until I spoke with Attorney David Tarr. Speaking with him was calming and reassuring, he listened and wasn\u2019t judgmental. After my consult he agreed to represent me in an out-of-town case, and I felt like he genuinely cared. Before the preliminary hearing I asked him to see what kind of plea deal they were offering. He came back and said let's go I\u2019m requesting a trial. Two years later the charges were dismissed, and my record expunged, all for the original fee. Anyone looking to protect their interest needs to seek Attorney Tarr, he will get you the best outcome possible.",

Needless to say I had an outstanding experience with Touma Law Group, particularly with my attorney, Alissa Wilson, and paralegal, Stephanie Jones. They expertly handled my legal issues, successfully expunging one charge and achieving the best possible outcome for another. What stood out the most was their genuine compassion and empathy; they made me feel valued and never judged me. They kept me informed throughout the process and truly treated my problems as their own. They were just as happy and excited as I was when this journey came to an end with the best possible outcome ever. I can\u2019t recommend them highly enough\u2014if you need justice served, this is the law group to choose. They have a lifelong fan in me! They will always remain at the top of my recommendation list for anyone needing legal assistance. I will forever sing their praises. Keep doing what you're doing Touma Law Group, because you're doing it right! Thanks again to Alissa Wilson and Stephanie Jones!",

He managed to make a chaotic legal system and process very understandable for me. He strategized my case and it goes without saying everything turned out in my favor. This experience was the motivating force for me to come back in June of this year for expungement. Attorney Grimes\u2019 staff has changed and expanded but I still received the same quality care, and commitment from them that I received from Attorney Grimes all those years ago. The office ladies are so polite, and professional. They communicate very well and at each step in your journey. Edina is super fast at responding to messages and questions through the client app. Amber is polite, friendly, and welcoming which goes a long way since she is the first person you meet. With this level of service, attention, and care  I will always use attorney Grines and associates!!!! Thank you again guys!",

There is  no other way to explain it.\n\nI had never been in trouble with the law. Well, except for when I was caught racing on the highway when I was 16 (20 yrs ago). Community service in Alabama is awful, by the way.\n\nI was terrified!! Mr. Knolton helped to assuage my fear! I spoke with him for my initial consultation with the firm. He explained everything so well.  He answered all of my questions so politely and truthfully. He explained the three things that could happen with my case. He was consulting with me on behalf of Jeff Grimes.\n\nJeff Grimes is the most epically awesome lawyer in the universe!! There isn't enough praise, in the world, that can be bestowed upon him!  October 4th, 2022, Jeff went in for my docket call to inform the judge that he was representing me. The very next day, Edina, Jeff's paralegal, called me.\n\nI was sure it was just to inform me of my trial date. She called and said Ms. Fowler, I have some good news! Mr. Grimes was able to get your case dismissed and expunged from your record yesterday. He spoke with the DA regarding your  case and was able to convince her to drop the case!!\n\nWhen Edina told me this I didn't even fully process what she had said. I asked her to repeat it. I was sure she had my case confused with someone else, but she didn't. I said, \"Wait, what did you just say? You have got to be kidding me! Wait, are you serious!?! \". I was in a state of ecstatic shock!! I ugly cried when we got off the phone. I 'ugly cry' very rarely. I can't recall any time in my life where I had sobbed from sheer joy, happiness, and relief of this burden.\n\nI requested to talk to Jeff in order to understand how he was able to get  my case dismissed pre-trial, on a DOCKET CALL! He called me within the hour and explained how it happened. I continue to be in utter amazement with the skills of my lawyer!\n\nThis was the first time I had ever spoken to Jeff on the phone. He was so personable, attentive, and polite. I was praising him during the entire phone call.  I still wear a huge smile on my face everytime I think about his unbelievable ability and competence as a lawyer.\n\nJeff's office is more than an hour away from my home. Even if his office were ten hours away, I will never choose anyone else to represent me. I am still stunned to this day. There aren't enough words in our language to explain how mesmerized I still am with Jeff and his team! Even if he retired, I would still bug him incessantly until he agreed to represent me if I were to get in trouble again.\n\nJeff Grimes and associates work so well together as a team! Jeff, Sam, Lauren, and Edina continue to impress me beyond comprehension. I am so extremely grateful to this team. Simply put, you would be a fool if you didn't choose Jeff to represent you!!\n\nJeff, Sam, Lauren, and Edina...THANK YOU SO MUCH for your competence and skills! I can't explain how grateful I am. Jeff has astonished me to the point that I view him as greater than a celebrity! Don't tell Jeff, but his prices are low! I would've paid him so much more if I had known how great he is!\n\nJEFF, THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART! I will never have a different lawyer from you, even when your office is more than an hour away from me.\n\nChoose this amazing team to represent you, too! If you were to not choose this firm to represent you, then you are simply ignorant (sorry, not sorry). I know this review is long, but I could write so much more!! I am still shocked with Jeff's competence.\n\nTHANK YOU JEFF! THANK YOU EDINA! THANK YOU LAUREN! THANK YOU SAM!\n\nChoose Jeff Grimes and associates, there's simply no one else like this team! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!\n\n-Andrea Fowler",

You can tell he\u2019s very respected in the courtroom. When it was all said and done, J. Runyon got my case dismissed with ZERO charges! He\u2019s the best money I\u2019ve ever spent!

My husband and father of our children faced serious felony charges and Mr. Schnayerson orchestrated the best possible outcome that brought leniency from the judge at an extremely reasonable cost. Recently Phil's experience and influence was again paramount in having my husband's original count reduced to a misdeamenor and expunged.  My husband is free of the stigma, able to move on with confidence and begin a new career.  Honestly, Phil's commitment to my husband's case, to see the whole person, and not his error in judgement, gave us hope and a favorable resolution. We are very grateful to Phil and his team!",

Philip Schnayerson will not only fight for you but will also do something not all lawyers will do and that is to make it personal.\n\nI decided to hire Phil around 10 years ago ago on a case that was so impossible to attain, POST CONVICTION. Not only did he accept the case but what made it even more difficult was it was a conviction outside his county of ALAMEDA from 5 years back and to a county  unfamiliar to him which was 3 hours away. His ABSOLUTE REASONABLE FEES never changed upon learning additional detailsit and his approach was the sharpest I've never imagined. Not only did he get the case expunged but due to his EXORBITANT SKILLS,  he went further but getting the judge to VACATE the conviction due to CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITIES. And when you got more questions or need additional help 5 years after, He and Carla (His SECRETARY) continue to serve as though you were family.\n\nTo the readers of this review, I would say Go to Atty. Philip for all your legal help. He is not just a a dedicated, knowledgeable; sharp and professional counsel BUT a man WHO COULD BE ENTRUSTED. to fight for you",

I could tell she genuinely cares about her clients. She clearly presents everything you're legally facing, what you need to do on your end, and everything she plans to do on her end to win your case. When you need to contact her, she's a simple text or phone call away. When you have questions, she patiently and clearly explains everything to you.\n2. She's professional and highly experienced. She's been there and done that. Consequently, she knows what she's doing and if your case is winnable, your chances of winning increase by hiring her as your lawyer.\n3. She's very personable and nice. She has great relationships with many key contacts/prosecutors at the courthouses, meaning that it's highly probable that they're more willing to work with her to get your charges reduced/dismissed.\n4. When she made one small mistake when communicating to me about my next monthly payment, she ended up reducing that month's fee by a few hundred dollars out of her professional courtesy. She didn't have to do that.\n5. Finally, she got my charge reduced despite all the evidence against me. I plan to get the leftover charge on my record expunged once a year hits and hire her again to handle that.\n\nAll in all, I'm thankful to God for Ann - she did an absolutely incredible job getting my charge reduced. She was fantastic to work with. I highly recommend that you hire Ann Gottesman as your lawyer. You won't regret it!",

What is it exactly that you want, or better yet, what do you and your family NEED?\nDo you want someone to be just professional and handle your case expertly, or do you NEED someone to work diligently day in and night out on your case, be thoroughly informative, and handle the entire weight of your legal situation both firmly and delicately?\nDo you want someone to contact you once your case is done or do you NEED someone to be available 24/7, through emails, calls, and office visits, have any and every question answered? You will always be informed with all the inner workings of court, even when you dont have to be present.\nDo you want someone that will give you a consultation and charge you and arm and a leg or NEED someone that has fair rates,  understands whatever economic hardship your going through, and creates flexible payment plans that cater to you? His consultations are free and put your mind at ease.\nIf you just want Joe Schmoe to take your money, and never hear back from, and most likely bend to the will of the court system than Mr. Cargal is not your guy. But, if you NEED someone in your corner to fight for and with you as I did during my overwhelming cases, than Matthew Cargal is most definitely the attorney you NEED to represent you!\nMr. Cargal helped me with two of my cases, one in 2013 and another slip up in 2014. With a 98% success rate, I figured it would be a no brainer to look him up. In both cases, he successfully tipped the scales in my favor and my family are forever grateful. It's been 5 years now no incidents, and he is currently working toward expunging both. Matt and I have created a trust, that I will forever hold dear, and he would do so with everyone that stumbles upon him. So dont hesitate to give Matt a call! Thank you again Matt, you've saved me time and time again, and it's safe to say, you've changed my life for the better!",

I needed to expunge my felony that I had in 2000. Also, In 2005 I was charged for a misdemeanor and again for the same incident in 2007. Unfortunately, I was 3 days out before my probation was over and the Judge denied my expungement for the 2007 case. Luckily I was able to get my felony expunged, but not reduced to a misdemeanor that was also denied by the Judge.\n\nI was doing pretty well if I may say, after all that I still managed to graduate from a college, and start my career, but then again in 2015 I caught another case. This times a DUI misdemeanor. I was able to continue working with out anyone noticing my DUI  \u201cThank GOD\u201d, but eventually in 2018 I changed jobs and had to inform my employer and still got hired, which was great but in 2020 my company I worked for shut down. Now I was in for a \u201crude awakening\u201d how am I going to manage to find a job with a 2007 case that was denied expungement, 2015 DUI, and a ex convicted felon. Now I have a rap sheet, and thought to my self my future is finished.\n\nThen there he was, as if he was \u201cGOD SENT\u201d I saw all the reviews for Mr. Jeff Voll online and decided to give the lawyer a chance, and boy did I make the right decision. Long story short, he did the impossible he managed to get my denied misdemeanor expunged, he expunged my dui, and the biggest hurdle of all he was able to file a motion, and get my denied reduction of my expunged felony reduced down to a misdemeanor.My expunged felony reduced that's  so Unrealllll!!!\n\nI highly recommend Attorney Mr. Jeff Paul Voll, by far one of the best lawyers I ever came across, and I\u2019ve had my fare share of attorneys in my life. I\u2019m not exaggerating this guy is like JESUS, and floats on water. He worked on all my cases and was just knocking them out the park.\n\nThis lawyer I kid you not is bad A$$, If you find your self In a mess that you need to clean up Hire him, and he will get it done\u2026He wiped my record clean, just think of that. Thank you Jeff you ROCK!!!!",

Jeff is easy to talk to and is very down to earth. I enjoyed speaking with Jeff on the phone because you could tell that he was a man who gave you his undivided attention. Furthermore, Jeff was straight up. He didn't beat around the bush. He told me I had a good chance to win the case based on his history of cases but of course it's never a 100% slam dunk. I'm glad he was straight with me from the beginning. I looked around a lot for lawyers but Jeff really outshined them all. Especially when he made me aware that there is no reason for lawyers to charge additional to try and turn a wobbler felony into a misdemeanor during expungement. To think, some of these other lawyers were ready to charge me over $200+ to \"put in paper work for a felony reduction to misdemeanor.\" In short, Jeff is as legit as they come, and he doesn't play any games. You get a solid lawyer who communicates well all at a value.",

And trouble getting good jobs.\n\nWith regard to immigration, the consequences  of my two year conversation was extremely serious. Immigration charged me with an aggravated felony which carries a mandatory penalty of PERMANENT bar from living in the U.S.\nI have been a permanent resident since I was 3y. this is my home!\nI desperately needed a post conviction relief, to solve my immigration problem.\n\nBefore hiring Mr Escovar, I had attempted to get my charges reduced 3 prior times with 3 different attorneys without a shred of success. It was a total waste of time and money. I was running out of time!\nI never gave up hope and I prayed for a miracle. My prayers were answered when I found Attorney Steve Escovar on yelp.\n\nMr. Escovar and his team did something that no other attorney EVER did before. He really listened to me and RESEARCHED my case.\nHe knows the laws and was able to use new laws to my advantage.\nHe worked hard to get me the post conviction relief that I needed.\n\nMy hope was to, at best, get my charges reduced,\nInstead Mr. Escovar got ALL charges DISMISSED!\n\nI will never forget when the Judge said: \u201cYou now have a clean record \u201c.\n\nI am still in amazement at what Mr. Escovar was able to do.\nAnd his pricing is more then reasonable.\n\nThank you Mr Escovar and Ms Mateus for getting me out of what seemed like an impossible situation.\n\nUPDATE: December 2021 DHS dismissed the case against me.

He's very responsive and always talks to you like it's your first meeting with him.  This is a very rare attribute for an attorney, and I don't know how he's able to maintain such sympathy and composure all the time.  I hired Chris to help me get out of a post DV case mess and he simply cruised through it.  The outcome was successfully removing TRO, terminating probation, and getting an expungement.  The attorneys I consulted before Chris all made these tasks sound impossible, and of course they still would charge you a hefty, forbidden amount of fee.  That's why I was so impressed by Chris' work; he really knows what he's doing.  I would highly recommend Chris to anyone who's seeking an outstanding, reliable attorney.",

I can't thank them enough for the professional, courteous and competent representation that I received from the initial consultation to the jury verdict (Not guilty).\n\nEven after a couple years past the conclusion of my case, Attorney Mullins called me and informed me of changes in legislation that allowed for cases like mine to qualify for expungement. Attorney Mullins drafted the necessary paperwork and petitioned the court on my behalf and I was granted an expungement, which allows me to enjoy the same status that I enjoyed prior to being arrested and charged. Talk about over-delivery!\n\nAttorneys Merrida Coxwell and Chuck Mullins and the rest of the staff are a great team to have on your side. I highly recommend you giving them a call. You will not regret it.",

When I came into his office the first time, I was nervous and uncertain about how the next few months were going to play out. From our first meeting, he reassured me we were going to get through it together with the best possible outcome... and he absolutely delivered. From our meetings, to court, he was with me every step of the way and got me exactly what I had hoped for. On top of all that, he genuinely cared about me and my situation. If I ever need an attorney again, he's gonna be my only call.  If you ever need a great attorney, he should be your only call.\nThank you again, Devin.",

Then he never filed a dismissal when he said and I ended up having to pay more out of my pocket by going on probation.  Now that that\u2019s done he is supposed to file and expungement as was agreed upon from the beginning. Guess what? Still not responding to me!  So now I have to file a complaint with the Bar association and maybe file a suit against him for part of my money back!!

Mr.Medley and his staff always kept the information flowing, and were forward and honest about what to expect, consequences and even the over all out look. It was also a relief to have one attorney to handle everything from acquiring a drivers license, fighting the charges and even getting it expunged from one's record. I hope never to have to go through this process ever again, or anyone. But, it does make it easier with Mr.Medley and his staff by your side the whole time.",

Mr. Medleys office is centrally located downtown Houston, close to the courthouse which makes it easy to see Mr. Medley and go directly to the courthouse. Mr. Medley is very straight forward when it came to my son's case. Mr. Medley was able to explain the law to my son and I, and our options according to the law. He is knowledgeable about the law and was able to achieve quick results and judgement from court without many lost days from work. Mr. Medley's demeanor in court is excellent, and with his knowledge of the Harris County court system resulted in an amicable and quick resolution between the court and my sons'  case.  I highly recommend attorney Jim Medley to anyone who needs legal, criminal advice, or his expertise. I also just hired Mr. Medley to expunge my sons' record",

Whether the legal problems were brought on by the foolishness of youth, being in the wrong place at the wrong time or mental health issues Philip was there for us.  From traffic tickets to DUIs to more serious issues like felonies, Philip always nanaged to get the best possible results with little to no impact on their permanent records.  When needed he also handled the expungements. Philip is very professional with a vast knowledge of the laws in Illinois but more importantly he is compassionate.  He had to provide lots of hand holding for me as my kids struggled through. His legal assistant Pam is also fantastic and was always there to take my calls and calm me down. I highly recommend the Law Office of Philip R. Nathe.  He is excellent.",

I had/have a clean record but was issued a biased ticket anyway.  There was a lot of legalese involved, where that ticket could have gone on my record as a conviction (5 years) and would have never been a simple court supervision deal.   To explain the ins and outs of it, I\u2018d be writing a lightweight memoir.  However, it was the totality of the situation that prompted me to look for an attorney.\nAfter searching, I came across the 5 star rated law practice of Attorney Craig Boston.  I then called his contact number.  His message on his greeting says (paraphrasing), that his goal is/was to return your call within 24 hours of receipt of it \u2026and he did!  Imagine my surprise, this attorney with several hundred 5 star reviews, who undoubtedly was/is extremely busy\u2026got back to me!  (A little ole everyday person like me) as he said he would, not only within 24 hours BUT with a free consultation and clear direction that resolved my case!\nI\u2019ll just put the brakes on for you and say \u201cplease stop\u201d and look no further because he is an expert in \u201call things traffic\u201d.  \u2026.Experienced, talented and very knowledgeable of his craft\u2026personable, no \u201cairs\u201d, no \u201cfronts\u201d\u2026he just immediately puts you at ease and your fears to rest and makes you feel so comfortable in his direct approach to a resolution. I have never experienced such a warm exchange with an attorney in my life! (And believe me; I\u2019ve sifted through \u201cthe deck\u201d with my sons.)  I could go on and on with accolades and adjectives about this man, simply because he is a \u201cjewel\u201d as you\u2019ll certainly find out if you ever require his services.  A 5 star rating doesn\u2019t do him justice \u2013 a 10 star rating would be more suitable for a person of his caliber.\nI\u2019m certain, that you can tell from what I\u2019ve written above that I would recommend him in a \u201cheartbeat\u201d and you will too, if you ever cross paths!  Attorney Boston\u2026Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!",

          "text": "Absolutely ruined my future and career when I was 19 and now I'm 27 and struggling because of TIM MARTIN'S lies. I was charged with a DUI with no Breathalyzer evidence or video evidence. Only verbal evidence. He did not care at all about my case or my future. He acted like supervision was the only way to handle this case when it CLEARLY should've been dismissed. NOOOOO EVIDENCE!!! but he was too lazy and ruined my career forever because he didn't care and I paid tens of thousands of dollars thinking he would try extra and I was in good hands. Tim Martin is absolutely horrible. He convinced me that \"supervision\" was a great idea. ATTENTION ALL THAT HE LIES TO! SUPERVISION REGARDLESS OF INNOCENCE CAN NEVER BE EXPUNGED IN ILLINOIS! NOT EVER! Do not let him convince you that this is a grand idea. IT IS A LAZY ATTORNEY IDEA. YOU CAN PAY THE SAME AT ANOTHE OFFICE AND ACTUALLY GET YOUR CASE DISMISSED. He is a money mill and does not give a care in the world and will try the very least. This awesome \"supervision\" he recommended (without any evidence against me) has followed me FORVER, 8 years later! I paid for a top quality lawyer because I was concerned about my future at 19 but years later I basically was better off pleading guilty. Its the same thing on your record.\n\n\"Unfortunately, if you received supervision on a DUI charge you are not eligible to expunge or seal it. Please let me know if you have any other questions. \"\n\nJust incase you're planning for a future and Tim Martin lies to you thats the response you will get from respected attorneys worth 10Xs the amount. TIM MARTIN IS A LIAR AND DESTROYS LIVES!!!",

Recently I took a new position in the casino industry and was having trouble getting approved for my gaming license due to a marijuana arrest I had over 15 years ago.  I was not convicted of this arrest but couldn\u2019t locate the document that verifies this.  The attorney who represented me at the time is now a judge and couldn\u2019t help me so I contacted Rob Stroh to see if he could assist me.  Rob acquired this document and sent it to the gaming commission here in Kansas who then approved my gaming license allowing me to start in my new career.  I initially was just expecting him to tell me how I could go about acquiring this document myself but Rob went above and beyond and did it for me at no charge!  Extremely grateful to Rob Stroh and his law office and I plan to utilize them soon as he explained to me he could get the arrest expunged as well.",

Given the severity of the situation, I sought out the expertise of Tony to act as my attorney. I was immediately reassured by his professional yet empathetic demeanor and his unwavering confidence in resolving my case.\n\nTony demonstrated an adept understanding of the law and a tactical approach, which ultimately led to the dismissal of all my charges. The only condition imposed was my attendance at a two-day ARC class - an effortless task considering the potential implications. Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised when a portion of my bail was refunded - a testament to Tony's relentless efforts to secure the best outcome for his clients.\n\nAs an entrepreneur who travels frequently, I was in dire need of a swift and efficient resolution. Adding to the complexity, I am currently in the process of petitioning for my fiance's move to the US, making it paramount to maintain a clean record. Tony not only handled my case seamlessly but also made sure the results were secured in a timely fashion.\n\nTo say that I am happy with the outcome would be an understatement. I am overjoyed, grateful, and above all, impressed with Tony's proficiency and dedication to his clients. His skillful navigation of the legal waters provided a sense of comfort during an otherwise stressful period.\n\nFor those requiring legal aid, particularly individuals managing a business or those with frequent travel commitments, I cannot recommend Tony highly enough. His expertise in the field and dedication to his clients truly set him apart. He is not just an attorney - he is a reassuring beacon in the stormy seas of the legal world.",

Explained to her the situation, as well as my concern in maintaining federal criminal clearances for work.\n\nLynn assured me that by pleading noli prosequi, the judge would assign community service instead of a sentence.  She also assured that no criminal history would appear on my record. I paid over $2000 for her representation. The charges were dismissed and I completed community service hours.\n\nMonths after the court date, I completed the federal background check.  Sure enough, the arrest record appeared on a federal background check.  I notified Lynn's office.  They said they were \"shocked\", would look into it, and would call me back.  They never did.\n\nI contacted the courthouse and found them more helpful than Lynn.  The court clerk encouraged me to seek a \"dismissal restriction\" from the judge, which would clear my record even on the federal level.  After one simple email to the judge, he granted the dismissal restriction. Record cleared.\n\nAt the end of this ordeal, Lynn's services were misleading, pricey, and seemingly useless.",

He took a case that felt like the book was thrown at me and turned it into a matter of simple probation until drug and alcohol classes were finalized and a really cheap fine. $2,000 fine nocked down to $1,000. He also got it expunged after i completed the program. Can't beat that. And he makes you feel confident in his work making you not stress so much if its your first time. Even if its not your first time I know he will be able to help reduce the punishment. When in trouble with the Law in Georgia definitely save money and hire the best!!",

Attorney Turner has not only avoided my calls and texts, but he  is not responding at all. The following text was sent on April 11.. Hey Ms. Shiela, it\u2019s Joey Turner. I\u2019m sorry to leave you waiting. I had two jury trials that have been going on, and I\u2019ve missed you each time.\n\nWe should have those record restrictions almost done. Let me check with the DA to see if they\u2019ve signed the paperwork. I\u2019ll give you a call by tomorrow on that. I have not received the services for which I paid for. I have repeatedly tried to reach Mr. Turner and have not gotten any response. This is quite unprofessional and disrespectful.",

I had tried to look at the Georgia Code related to my situation myself over and over again, but I was totally confused about what I needed to do. That's because the laws, by their very nature, lacked a lot of the practical context involved in the day-to-day records management practices in Georgia's records systems. Javonte knew, off of the top of his head, impressively detailed information about record codes and practices and answered questions I had that were--to me--almost too complex to put into words. He walked me through a baffling GCIC background check document that I'd been having a lot of trouble understanding-- so many codes and fields and information.  He answered me clearly and completely, and was very open open letting me ask questions. I didn't feel rushed nor pressured at any point. I contacted the firm ready to pay them for what I thought I might need, but rather than let me do that, Javonte told me there was a much simpler way I could try to get what I needed and not have to pay either a lawyer or the court: advising me to try that before I paid anyone anything. He gave me such a large, clear amount of information and help in about 15 minutes that at the end of it, I really felt guilty that this had only been a free consultation. I wanted to pay them something, because Javonte basically solved the problem that's been keeping me awake at night for weeks. He said, that was okay, just tell people about my experience. So that's what I'm doing here. It's not only that Javonte related a lot of information to me in a clear and patient way. It's also that I felt very much that the firm would not charge me for unnecessary activities. If you need help with expungement/restriction/record sealing, I'd highly recommend calling DeVetter Law Firm!",

I got my license back within days and fortunately was absolved of any wrong doings. He then got my records sealed and destroyed by the court. Very solid person and didn\u2019t lead me astray with unrealistic promises as far as the outcome of the case. I highly recommend his services!!",

I was able to talk with him same day.\nJimmy made it clear he understood all the actions needed and that he would guide me through things step by step. He also was clear on setting expectations regarding the time needed for things to get through the system and outcomes.\nJimmy was very responsive to any questions I had during the proceedings. He provided me updates timely and clearly. Jimmy replied to any questions I had same day and often with a phone call.\nHe was very practical in all things regarding my case. He offered me exceptionally good advice on some proactive actions I could take that would help my case.\nIt was great advice, and I am certain it help get me an incredibly good outcome at my day in court.\nJimmy was fair on his billing, did not have unexpected costs, and was generous with his time.\nIt was great to have him on my side of the legal matters.",

The District Attorney had absolutely no interest in hearing the facts of the case & wanted to move forward with the case based on my prior convictions.  I obtained a public defender that despite his best efforts was unable to negotiate a plea bargain of any kind with the District Attorneys\u2019 office. At one of my court appearances I was observing Steven represent one of his clients.  I was blown away with what I saw; I thought for sure this guy was going to jail. The mutual respect Steven shared with the D.A. was obvious & worked in his clients favor resulting in a reduced charge, no jail time & the minimum fine with a small amount of community service. I was facing serious jail time & had exhausted all options. I hired Steven & the results were immediate. The D.A. agreed to a smaller amount of jail time & although still expensive a much lesser fine. Steven said  \u201cWe can do better Chris\u201d.  That sentence really sums up my experience with Steven, when Steven said \u201cWe\u201d he meant it. The fight for my future became Stevens & he was determined to attain the best outcome possible. Steven treated me & everyone involved with the up most respect. As an 8 year veteran & a Non Commissioned Officer I know the meaning of respect, integrity & loyalty, Steven exemplifies all of these qualities. In the end I received NO jail time & a very, very small fine. I did have to plead guilty, however Steven followed through with my case & was able to have my probation terminated early along with my record being expunged. I now have a clean record & was able to attain an amazing job that had been lost now that my background check was clean.  I HAVE A FUTURE AGAIN. If you have a case in Orange County, especially Fullerton you NEED Steven Bloom as your attorney. I can thank you enough Steven thank you for making the impossible possible again.",

I was slapped with a Trumped up 1st Degree felony Charge by some over zealous police officers and was facing some very serious jail time. The whole incident was a big misunderstanding. I thought i would spend decades in Jail but due to Cody's strategic defense and aggressive negotiation tactics, he  was  to work out a deal with the DA to completely dismiss my charge entirely upon completion of a reasonable 15 month (Pre-Trial Intervention Program) PTIP program. Upon completion of the Program I will be able to have my record completely expunged and finally put this unfortunate incident behind me.  I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend hiring Cody Cleveland if you or your loved one finds themselves in trouble with the law. You get what you pay for and he is worth every penny!",

BEST OUTCOME IMAGINABLE! Thank you to Pricila and Mr. Ross for all you did for me and continue to do for others. As much as I loved having them on my side, I hope to never need legal assistance again Lol. However,  I will always refer anyone who needs legal counsel to Ross Law Offices.

I\u2019m happy to say that 7 years later she has since gotten her GED, gone to Dental Assistant School and has been clean and sober almost 5 years. Daniel was able to get her record expunged and she is doing great!  Her and I both can not thank him enough!  I apologize for taking so long to come back and say thanks! Those were some of the hardest years we, as a family, had been through and he made it so much easier!",

He gave 100 % communication when it came to my case, and I never had to step foot in the courthouse. I really appreciate him working this out for me as this has been reduced to a lesser charge as well as it being expunged off my record. If you're needing a criminal lawyer don't hesitate to hire him because he definitely will get job done!",

Last summer, I found myself in a not nice situation, and I got arrested for the first time. My world just collapsed. I was so disappointed in myself and scared of the consequences that could happen. I did research and made a few calls to law firms. They all sounded like this: leave your information, and we will contact you back. When I called the Michael Sahn office, it was different right away. The lady who answered the call was very nice and polite, and I could feel that they DO care about their clients. After a few questions, I was transferred to speak directly to Michael. He listened to my story, and without any superior promises, he agreed to work on my case. He said he couldn't guarantee anything but would do his best to achieve the best results. What he did. I never needed to come or contact the court on my own. Michael Sahn completely took care of everything. Yesterday, my charges were expunged. It's the best outcome that I didn't ever expect. Michael beat any of my expectations with his professionalism. He is super compassionate, very responsive, and responsible. He knows how to listen and listens without any judgment; he is honest and straightforward. There are no hidden fees, the whole process was transparent, and Michael Sahl updated me about every step in my case.\nI recommend his Attorney service to anyone who is in need. He is The Professional! I honestly would give 10 stars if I could.\nI can't say enough of the \"thank you\" to Michael! You are the best! God bless you and your family!",

I was working a great job when I got hit with a hiccup I had to take care of before I was able to return to work. I was referred to Attorney Seth Rose to assist with partaking in my expungement but he felt one of his colleagues (Attorney Michael Sahn) could better assist. From the start of my process Attorney Sahn was ready to work with me as soon as I told him the charge. He informed me that the expungement process was 8-12 weeks and his retainer fee was very affordable. As soon as my fees were paid the process started immediately! Today as I write this review I can honestly say he is the perfect representation for any case given. I no longer have to worry about that charge hindering me from any job I apply to in the future. As I kept myself busy throughout the weeks he was working behind the scenes. Thank you again for everything Attorney Sahn!!!!!!!",

Honestly shocked that he was able to provide this outcome for me. Not only did he get me a better outcome I could ever imagine, he also was attentive to my feelings while going through the process.

I have nothing but GREAT things to say about him. if you need a lawyer...don't chance it, contact him. It will be one of the best decisions you will make during your case! THANKS AGAIN ADAM!",

During the Initial call I was able to speak directly to Mrs. Babi and she was very informative and direct about the process. Mrs. Babi is about you as a person, regardless of background which is very comforting in the present situation. After speaking about the process I was completely on board with Mrs. Babi and was ready to get my troubles behind me. Mrs. Babi\u2019s fees for her law firm an expertise was extremely reasonable and affordable. As the process started Mrs. Babi is very communicative to walk you through the process at hand via phone and emails to answer questions along the way. The whole process for me ( individual situations will vary) was under six months from start to finish. I cannot be more ecstatic an pleased in the services and professionalism that was extended to me and my family with the individual care and comfort Mrs. Babi law firm gave to me. I highly recommend Mrs. Babi an her law firm to represent you and your families law needs, you won\u2019t be disappointed, I\u2019m not! James. J",

I thought with the judge saying \"case dismissed\" there would be no record, but that is not the case. I was glad Shawn brought this to my attention so we could follow  up with  getting the expungement. I'm glad I chose Shawn Cline and would recommend him. He is easy to talk to and he had my best interest at heart.",

When I did end up in need, I knew of plenty attorneys that I didn't want representing me, but none that I actually did want.\nIn May of 2019 I was arrested due some false allegations against me. I heard about Mr. Wolf from a friend and contacted him immediately. After talking to John, and his partner Andrew, I decided they were the right choice for me and for my case. They immediately went to work for me. They met with me, spoke with me on the phone, texted, and responded to emails throughout the day and after hours, whenever I needed it. There was nothing I was in want for.\nJohn, Andrew, and I decided to fight my case at the front end with the grand jury. This is no small feat, as grand juries usually only hear from the prosecutor. It took nearly a year and a half for the prosecutor to take my case to the grand jury. John and Andrew put together a \"defense packet\" and were able to get it pushed through so that the grand jury could review it. This is almost unheard of here in small town West Texas. When the case came back as officially a No-Bill, Mr. Wolf and Mr. Stallings both called me immediately to let me know.\nI feel confident that we would have won this case in a trial, and for me, there was no other option. I was innocent and not about to plea in any other way. Both John and Andrew agreed and never tried to persuade me otherwise. John and Andrew's hard work spared us the trauma, time, humiliations and yes, money, that a trial would have brought.\nThey are still doing some work on expungement for me on my case, and there is absolutely nobody I would trust more.\nIf you need a good criminal attorney I would definitely look into hiring Wolf & Stallings.",

I found myself in a very challenging situation after making a significant mistake, and the weight of it felt almost unbearable. I was worried about the long-term impact on my life and future opportunities, but Andrew's expertise and unwavering support turned everything around for me.\n\nFrom the moment I reached out, Andrew was incredibly understanding and compassionate. He took the time to thoroughly explain the legal process, making sure I understood each step and what to expect. His professionalism and attention to detail were evident throughout, but it was his genuine concern for my well-being that truly made a difference.\n\nAndrew\u2019s meticulous work and strategic approach led to a successful expungement of my record. The relief and sense of closure I feel now are immeasurable. It\u2019s like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and I am finally able to look forward to the future with optimism.\n\nI couldn't be happier with the results or the service I received. Andrew Popplewell is not only an outstanding attorney but also a dedicated advocate who genuinely cares about his clients. If you find yourself in a tough spot and need someone who will fight for you with expertise and empathy, Andrew is the person to turn to. Thank you, Andrew, for everything you've done for me\u2014your work has made a profound difference in my life.",

First of all I liked the website so I called and talked with a case screener.  I said I could send some information that would greatly help.  This was an informational letter I had sent to probation to get certain conditions lifted.  At the start I was on probation for a felony and in the end, all cases were marked as dismissed.  It took a few months, but Mr. Ridley and his staff came through.  I was off probation, the felony was reduced to a misdemeanor, then both cases expunged.  much praise to Brian and Atty. Michelle for their determined work to assure a good outcome.  If you're on probation don't mess it up, and be sure to call Doug Ridley's.  Nothing quite like looking up your records and seeing DISMISSED.  Bravo!",

I was wrongfully accused by police and had to deal with the Stamford court.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as mark walked in, it was clear he was connected and everyone respected him and his team. He has both finesse and ferocity.\u00a0\u00a0He was also great with my family during a very stressful case. He and his partner Amanda Telesco took the time to understand the details of my case and fought hard for me.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So hard that my entire case was DISMISSED and EXPUNGED.\n\nSo worth the money. I couldn't have asked for a better attorney, and I highly recommend him to anyone in need of expert legal assistance. So glad I hired him. Highly recommend!",

They helped me through two expungements, one of which, due to unforeseen circumstances through no fault of their own, took over a year to be rectified. Catherine, who was assigned to my case, was excellent in every way. She was extremely friendly and responsive anytime I would reach out to her with any questions I had or updates on my case. It has been over an entire year, like I mentioned before, ( and I want to be clear, this was only due to a problem in the governments records because of how old my case was) of often reaching out to me, just to let me know she was still doing all she could to clear my record. I just spoke with her two days ago and she gave me the relieving news, that finally my expungement had been approved. I would recommend such an amazing team to anyone, and would without hesitation, call on them for any legal assistance I would need in the future.",

I reached out a year later because I was pulled over by a police officer and they told me that it was still a felony on my name and all Tiffany did was send me the minutes that stated it wasn\u2019t but nobody made sure that my record was adjusted to a misdemeanor for two years. I was out of work because of this law firm. When I reached out for a reimbursement because I was a \u201cfelon\u201d , they told me to find another law firm as if I already didn\u2019t for an expungement. Meanwhile, I had to discover while applying for my internship at a hospital that these people never got their job done And instead of trying to blame it on the state, but I paid YOU as my lawyers though to get the job done correctly ????????????NOT HALF ASSED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a mistake a public defense attorney would make not a \u201chigh-end law firm\u201d.  Thank you for SMEARING MY RECORD ! Don\u2019t waste your money here.",

At the time I thought I\u2019d never get out of this mess but she knows what she\u2019s doing. Trust her work and trust the process and she will deliver. I\u2019m more than happy and blessed and I\u2019m staying of trouble hopefully for good now but she definitely the one you need to work with. Thanks so much you guys @ SlagerLawFirm",

Definitely a great law firm to work with, would recommend to anyone.",

She was straight forward and very professional the whole process letting me know what to do on my end and what she in return would do on hers to get the outcome we were aiming for and we got exactly that. Communication was never a problem. Also she works with you if you have to utilize a payment plan which was very convenient. This is my first and hopefully my last time having to use a lawyer but if I ever needed another one I know where I\u2019m going and who I\u2019m recommending others to. You can\u2019t go wrong worth ever penny spent to not have any probation and have it expunged off my record. Madison at the front desk is even great, a very welcoming non judgmental environment to help you with your needs!",

I appreciated that they were willing to do a payment plan if I ended up needing to and that there was a flat rate for my case and anything pertaining to my case (they\u2019ve been working with me for 7 months now on only the initial flat fee!) I appreciate the whole team at Slager and would recommend them to anyone needing legal help in the area.",

No probation either, simply had to pay court cost and take a class and it\u2019s over. Even the event of the charges and initial arrest can be expunged in two years as if it NEVER HAPPENED!\nIt\u2019s literally the best money I\u2019ve ever spent. Changed the course of my life no doubt! I found Mr.Taylor via the amazing reviews he had within the Rutherford County/ Murfreesboro area and they couldn\u2019t have been more correct. I owe him my freedom so the least I could do was come here and let the world know that there ARE good attorneys out there and Mr.Taylor sets that bar. Thank you again, John!",

I had a warrant for failure to complete probation that went back over 12 years. I currently live in Ohio and contacted Mr.Bennett for a free consultation to see exactly what my options were! He gave great advice and was able to tell me exactly what I was being charged with and his professional opinion on how to resolve it in the best way possible. From that moment, I knew he was the lawyer I needed. My husband and I were able to retain him and he went straight to work once we traveled to Tennessee to resolve these issues. Not only was he able to get me in front of a judge the next day, the advice he gave ended up helping my situation and I only had to serve 48hours and my record has been expunged! Mr.Bennett, there is no way I could ever thank you enough for helping me move on with my life and put the horrible past behind me! You cannot go wrong!! Let him go to work for you!! And Karen, Mr.Bennetts assistant, she is the sweetest lady and I just want to say thank you to the both of you for helping me and treating me like a human being and not a criminal!\nNicole T.",

Melissa would be Scotty Pippen as it pertained to my charges.\nLet\u2019s start with How? I am very close with a County Court Clerk  in the area. Clerks are the pulse of the criminal justice system In which I found myself being held hostage. My career depended upon a specific  outcome in my favor. My Clerk Friend without hesitation implored me to \u201c Call James, I love that man\u201d. After my dealings with Mr. Rutherford, that makes two of us.\nLet\u2019s go to the Why?  I needed my case to not see the \u201c In God We Trust\u201d above the judges head on my first court date. Seemed impossible! Well Attorney James Rutherford made the impossible possible.  Dismissed of all charges before my first court date.\nThe sensitive position I hold in the community requires that my perfect record stays as is.  Although it was not such a serious charge it must be expunged for me to create my dreams now and in the future. It was time sensitive and a very difficult task. James and Melissa were on it immediately and for this I am forever grateful.\nGood attorneys are around yes. In fact I come from a family with 3 Attorneys sitting around the table. James Rutherford, however, is the best. his level of professionalism, timeliness and skills is second to none. This is not just my opinion it is my experience!",

Not only did they make me feel confident in my case again - a case in which I did not commit any type of crime - they got the judge to count the year I had waited as my parole served, and the case was dismissed once I completed 20 service hours. We even discussed what it would cost to get my record expunged in the future. As a 25 year old with a college degree and their whole life ahead of them, this is quite literally a life saving effort they made happen for me. Fantastic and honest crew. 12/10 stars if I could rate that high.",

They dig through every piece of evidence and research laws, pertaining to your case. When facing a lengthy jail or prison sentence for a crime that I didn't commit, Jacob Blizzard found the evidence that proved I was nit guilty and got all of the charges dismissed. Sarah Durham is also an amazing attorney and handled the expungment hearing. Yes, even when charges are dismissed, the arrests still show on your criminal history. So remember that if you're arrested, for any offense, the arrest show forever, unless they're expunged or sealed. I can't express how proud I am to have had Blizzard and Zimmerman on my side. I recommend them to anyone who needs an experienced attorney who doesn't simply go with the flow and hope for an outcome.",

I would refer them to my closest friend if they were in a similar situation.",

Keith Nedwick and Heather Strohmeyer are extremely knowledgeable, compassionate, and fought very hard for justice for me.  I cannot say enough about how hard they work on your behalf and how personable everyone is.  I felt taken care of and respected by everyone.  Rachel Ball was always a friendly voice keeping me informed and encouraged.  Heather Strohmeyer and Keith Nedwick were my protectors and champions.  Not only did Heather and Keith get my case completely dropped, they made sure that everything was expunged from my record almost immediately.  If you find yourself needing an attorney, do yourself a favor and don't think about hiring anyone else.  If I could given them more than 5 starts I would.  You can be confident that you are getting the very best representation from a whole team when you work with the Law Offices of Keith Nedwick.",

He actually cared about me getting well before I got sober in 2018 and instead of just wanting money only; he suggested I sit it out and go to rehab which looking back I appreciate so much!  He even helped me expunge my record for the DUI.  He also has helped my fiance prior to our sobriety who faced a 12 year sentence for non-violent drug charges (while I am a white woman who was in the same case who got offered 5 year deferred by the way!!!!) after sitting in jail fighting this for one year.  Once we hired Mr. Kuykendall, he was given a sentence of 3 years with 1 year served.  I can go on and on the amount of people close to me Mr. Kuykendall has helped and they all share similar experiences. I am a law student now and hands down-this is the best attorney I know thus far (after working with many around U.S. and also the many I have met/been taught by while in my Paralegal Studies Associate's program .  Look at his about section on the website and hands down-even if I did not know him personally-the experience and contributions to society make him the best choice in my opinion.  Thank you!",

I was a victim of police misconduct and racial profiling. The day that I contacted Atty. Daly he was immediately invested in my case and recognized all the flaws within the police department testimony. He kept an open communication throughout the process and always provided me with updates. On February 2, 2023 I was found NOT GUILTY because of the work Atty. Daly did and justice was served. I had a pending charge for one thing but they accuse me of something else, which did not add up. After a year and a half dealing with this knowing I was innocent all along, Atty. Daly is the one who helped me get through the case and fight for what he believe in, which is justice. This impacted my life mentally, emotionally, financially and physically but now I can finally live my life and pursue my dreams with a clean record. I highly recommend  him to anyone who is looking for a great criminal lawyer because you will not be disappointed. Thank you Atty. Daly for everything and believing in me!",

It was a smooth and positive situation with him and his law firm. Putting my trust into an attorney is something that is a really touchy subject they handled it smoothly and I am very appreciative of the outcome. Also Emily was great and responsive and I feel like they stayed on top of the situation for me and had me at ease through the process.",

Working with lawyers can feel daunting and often they are just insufferable know-it-alls. Demetrius was the opposite. He worked incredibly hard, went above and beyond and most importantly didn\u2019t \u201cnickle and dime\u201d me to death.\n\nLong story short- our case was successful! I couldn\u2019t be more grateful.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart.",

He was kind, professional, honest, and clear. He didn\u2019t rush me off of the phone, and seemed to actually care that I understood his answers.\n\nIt is not often in these crazy times to find a lawyer,  or anyone even, that is generous with their time and knowledge.\n\nThank you Demetrius for being a good person in this world, and in a few years when I need my arrest expunged, I\u2019ve got your number saved. I highly recommend him. He cares.",

I spoke to Shawn first and he was understanding, empathetic, and motivated to take my case.\n\nI worked mostly (about 99.99%) with Matt Martin and he was very professional and available to me at all times. I never had any doubt. I told him what I wanted to do and he took charge. I was up front and honest with Matt. I did everything he told me to do.\n\nAll I asked, is there would be no plea deals. I've always believed that innocent people don't plea.\n\nI've never been in a situation like I was before. Nor had any of my family or friends. From my experiences, you have to be your own lawyer and investigator as well. At least be familiar with some of the legal documents. Also, gather whatever you can. Phone records, doorbell camera footage, text messages, anyone who was in the area, etc. Matt took everything I had, even my story in greater detail. I did not forgot a thing, every detail is key. That night sticks with me to this day. Matt will tell you, \"we tell the truth\". And that's all we had.\n\nAfter nine months, going back and forth to court, the DDA (through Matt's work) agreed to drop charges that a lot of lawyers told me would never get dropped. Note: yes, I did reach out to a couple lawyers beforehand and most told me this case would never get dropped and either would get settled through a plea deal or going to trial. Matt was able to get my case dismissed and records sealed.\n\nI went through hell, it was rough. I truly believe Matt was put in my life by God. He believed in me because I told him the truth and nothing but the truth. He's the guy I would go into battle with any day, at any time, for any reason.\n\nI hired Matt to be my lawyer, in the end, he became my friend. Matt (and Shawn), if you ever need anything, I am there for you. Thank you for being there for me and allowing me to continue my life after that nightmare.",

Both charging the same fee. I chose Seth because our first phone conversation he already had all of my record pulled up, informed me of the fines and restitution I owed. I didn't know i had fines.\n(Pueblo court told me i owed nothing.) Seth treated me with respect. Seth didn't sound like he was too busy or as though I was bothering him. The other attorney did not. Seth was hassle free, did a speedy job, which is something I did not expect. I paid, I signed, answered a few questions and in a 3 months done. He also reduced my fines by $1500.00. Hire him!",

Miles, John and Libby made the ordeal painless, Miles and John actually work on cases together so your getting 2 attorneys for the cost. And in my book their fees were minimal considering they got the charges dropped through a deferment period and at the end of said time period the DUI will become reduced to a citation and I can have the whole ordeal expunged. They have great communication and service even after the bulk of the legal work is completed, they are personable, informative and they say call or email anytime with future questions or concerns. I feel luck to have found a firm as good as this one, I have met a few folks that have faced DUI in the past and they said their attorneys (different firms) didn't do a things for them and they still got the book thrown at them when it was all said and done. Not me, and I own it to Kinsell and Whitaker.",

What started as a phone call to report a serious road rage incident turned into a nightmare, with the Napa police filing multiple felony charges over a defensive statement I made during the call. This situation should have never escalated the way it did. The police took my frustration\u2014expressed after dealing with constant harassment from officers\u2014and attempted to give me two strikes for it.\n\nThe road rage incident itself was frightening: a person got out of their vehicle during a fit of road rage and began approaching me aggressively, forcing me to drive away for my safety. During the call to dispatch, I vented about how the police had been harassing me. Though I regret my choice of words, the context of provocation should have been obvious.\n\nAfter months of zero progress with a public defender who didn\u2019t seem to know what he was doing, my family hired Laina. She came into the case late\u2014near the end of my 14 months\u2014but her expertise turned things around. Laina genuinely sympathizes with people of color and is acutely aware of the unjust nature of the legal system. She effectively navigated the complexities of my case, addressing the incompetence that had been present in my defense. Laina saw through the prosecution's exaggerated narrative and successfully reduced my multiple felony charges to just one (Penal Code 71 for threatening an officer). After I completed my mandatory supervision, she helped me get that charge expunged, clearing my record, which is now just as it was before all this happened. This was my first and only charge, and Laina's work allowed me to remove this unfair burden.\n\nSince my release, I have completed my degree in biology from San Francisco State University, maintained a healthy lifestyle with daily exercise and a plant-based diet, and continued to receive counseling and support from professionals who highly recommend me. While I believe the harassment I faced from Napa officers should have been more effectively addressed by the justice system, I\u2019m grateful for the justice I received with Laina\u2019s help. Her expertise gave me a second chance to live my life freely without the impediment of a felony.\n\nIf you're looking for a lawyer who is skilled, compassionate, and relentless in her pursuit of justice, I highly recommend Laina. She made a tremendous difference in my life, and I will always be grateful.",

          "text": "Laina is amazing! I wanted to get my record expunged for employment reasons. She suggested we get my felony reduced to a misdemeanor then have my record expunged  so I would get my rights back.  I didn't even know that was possible. She asked me to get some letters of character and all my paperwork saying I had completed everything the court required as part of my original sentence. Once I got everything to her I was on the calendar within a few days. We went to court on November 19th and got everything taken care of. My record had been holding me back for years. I highly recommend Laina she is truly a great person and lawyer.",

Thankfully, I had plenty of evidence to show proof of rehabilitation for my expungement and with his help I was able to win my case. For the DUI, he saved me from spending an additional 4 days locked up. I would highly recommend him. His prices were not over the top and well worth the money invested. The best part was never having to step foot inside the courtroom and missing work. I could go on more about honeychurch but this review would be too long.",

He made sure we would be solid and prepared for our virtual meeting. Throughout the whole process I felt he cared about this as much as I did.He understood why I wanted this chapter in my life closed and ready for the new chapter to begin.

I was the co-defendant and the other defendant was facing a murder charge in a separate case that eventually was all intertwined into one case. The DA was tough, although I was completely unaware of the other defendants doings at that time and I was innocent of any wrongdoings, they charged me with different multiple serious felony counts of involvement because of my relationship with that defendant on a personal level. Kirby was able to get all the felony charges dismissed and reduced to a single misdemeanor disturbing the peace conviction with minimal plea terms, including only 1yr informal probation.\n\nOnce the informal probation was up, I then retained Kirby again to have that misdemeanor conviction expunged. Within weeks Kirby had that conviction and record expunged. Weeks later I retained Kirby again to expunge a DUI conviction I received over 10yrs ago. He first attempted to directly ask the DA, they refused to expunge that DUI. Those case expungements are on an individual case basis dismissed by a Judge. So once the DA refused Kirby immediately took my case to a judge and was able to get that DUI expungement for me as well.\n\nI cannot say with words how grateful I am to Kirby and to his wife Kim. Not only did they fight for me every step of the way but they showed true compassion and made sure I was always aware of everything going on. He literally saved my life from charges that could have left me behind bars for a very long time. If you're looking for a criminal defense attorney in Riverside county, look no further. There is no one else you can entrust your case in more than Kirby.",

It's extremely imperative if you are seeking legal counsel, to at least run your situation by Mr. Pozza. You only owe it to yourself to get his top rated opinion. They truly have been nothing short of amazing, and it has made all the difference. Every situation is different, but know if have Mr. Pozza, rest assured you will recieve top notch service from a lawyer who truly wants to help. I seriously can't thank them enough and look forward to an expungement process down the road!",

From the initial consultation, he was very knowledgeable, honest about the possible outcomes of things (good or bad), but most of all he was very easy to talk to and I never felt rushed in our conversations. Even with other items that the rest of the team took care of, they were always friendly and communication was great.  As far as my case goes, I couldn't be happier.  From the date of the arrest to being convicted was almost 14 months and in that time he represented me in my DMV hearing, had my DNA expunged, fought my criminal side and got amazing results (obviously the outcome is different for everybody).  Then when it was all said and done he communicated all aspects of the case with my civil attorney which didn't do a fraction of what Bill and his team did for me and charged me way more.  Bill only charged me the flat rate that was agreed upon in the beginning and the flat rate for the case needing to go to trial, he did so much above and beyond and never even hinted at charging more. So Overall I am extremely happy with the entire service I was provided and would recommend him to anyone needing a great criminal attorney in Weld County or nearby areas.  Thank you again McAdams Law Office!",

With a prior arrests for another weapons case in my past and being profile I was facing multiple felonies and time. Joe brang me into his office and explained how he would  be getting the charges reduced or dropped. It turns out that this silver tongued diablo also happens to be very well conected and respected in courty by the DA and by the judge. To my shock the case was dropped after only doing a couple hours of super chill community service. His law office seems very powerful and has tentacles that can reach out to personal friends within the system to help clients. After he scored my first victory I gave him a new case that was a speeding/ negligent driving case I didnt think he would actually win becous they had video, radar, and me admitting it. But they pulled the cop to the side and talked to him. Before you know it the judge said \"case dismissed\" and I was free again. Thanks to Joe for beating 2 unwinnable cases for me and for expunging a past during on my record I know have a clean record as well as the ability to walk into turners and purchase an ar15 to legally defend my home and family.

Result I just got the dismissal of my case. 2 this case took so long because he forgot/lost my documents so I have to retake my finger print. Money and time wasted. 3 sometime I felt that he has an actitud against me but I was maybe is just me. Until I ask him by email for an update and I got this response. Super disappointed. He charged me 3,000 for the dismissal of a misdemeanor and no expungement. So 3,000 for a haft way job and almost 1 year and 3 months of time.",

It was a traumatic experience and although I was cited as 80% at fault, I was told by my insurance company, it might be worth hiring a lawyer. I called several who did not work in Fort Bend, but someone recommended Scott Markowitz and another attorney. I interviewed them both and Scott is the only one who said, he was certain he could help me. AND HE DID!  He and Forrest were clear communicators, walked me through what they planned to do and were reasonably priced.  My case is over, my driving record cleared and I'm relieved.  Although in terms of cases, Scott did not make a lot of money, but he knew this mattered a great deal to me, and I felt it.  He even took the time after a probationary period to call me to make sure my paperwork was submitted on time. I can easily recommend Markowitz Law.  Thank you, Scott and Forrest.",

The legal process can be daunting, especially when dealing with felony expungements and rehabilitation certificates, but their team made every effort to ensure I felt supported and informed at every step.\n\nWhat truly sets Fresh Start Law Center apart is their transparency and commitment to client satisfaction. Initially engaging their services for a Certificate of Rehabilitation, I appreciated their honesty in outlining the full cost associated with the process.

The team was not only prompt in responding to my emails but also took the time to explain complex legal matters in a way that was easily understandable. This level of responsiveness and clarity significantly eased the stress of navigating the legal system.\n\nThe expungement process was handled with precision and efficiency. Fresh Start Law Center demonstrated a deep understanding of the legal intricacies involved, ensuring that all necessary documents were filed accurately and promptly. Their attention to detail and dedication to my case were evident throughout, resulting in the successful expungement of my felonies.\n\nObtaining a Certificate of Rehabilitation is no small feat, and Fresh Start Law Center navigated the complexities with finesse. Their expertise and commitment to justice were instrumental in securing this vital document, opening new doors for me as I move forward with my life.\n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Fresh Start Law Center to anyone seeking legal representation for felony expungements or certificates of rehabilitation.

I saw alot of reviews on this company and alot of the complaints I saw were of people complaining of the documentation they had to provide. I feel you get what you put in and this company is here to help you as much as you let it. That being said, before I even called I had a copy of my disposition ready to go. I took the eligibility test, sent an email and got a response within hours. I personally talked to Mr. Huffman, got a list of things I needed to get ready and got to work.  Even living in Texas, the process went by smooth and quick.  Mr. Huffman required a few documents I already had ready prior and I was able to get letters of recommendation immediately.  Again, some of the complaints I saw were of people expecting this company to do ALL the work completely for them, which I thought was a bit absurd, especially living in these times we're in full of restrictions and delays. My start date was 03 DEC 2020 and I got my record Expunged with paper work in by 05 APR 2021. Not bad for being 3 states over and not once having to go back to California for any reason.  Mr. Huffman kept me updated with both emails and their tracking system online.  If you are going to go with this company, just remember, YOU are hiring them, and they are only as effective as you let them be. So have all your ducks in a row and be ready to help with some paperwork in order to receive the fastest response times available. Thank You Mr. Huffman for everything, I can now push forward with my career.",

When talking on the phone he came off as though he was talking to a friend not a client. I asked him for advice a few times on how to word things or to get information and just came off as if I was bothering him.\n\nWith that being said I give this firm a 3 star rating. The lack of compassion really played a major role on my decision to write this review.\n\nLastly I want to say I am not writing this to hurt the firm. This is just my personal opinion based on my first hand experience with them. I will end by saying that if needed I would hire him again.",

I kept seeing  and hearing Larrys name and was interested but also hesitant. I thought since he was so good that he would have to many cases and wouldnt have enough time to give mine his full attention. I called his office on a Friday afternoon right before his office closed and got a hold of him. We set an appointment and he came in on a Saturday morning just to hear my situation and see what the next steps were. When I saw that he came in on a Saturday and had his full attention I knew he was the one. He started on the paper work to allow me to keep my license  until  my court hearing immediately. He also recommend that I do 40 hours of community service, and attend  a DUI and defensive driving course which I did. Two years have passed since then and a court date was finally set. Not only was i available to speak to Larry whenever but he always replayed or picked up his phone as well as his team. When ever I wrote an email or made a call there was always a replay with in 5 minutes. They kept me up to date with any changes or no changes in my case the whole two years i was waiting. I also had an immigration problem because i wasn't able to renew my work permit because of the pending case, he stayed in contact with my immigration lawyers the entire time keeping them up to date and also making sure what he wanted to do wouldn't affect my immigration problem in a negative way. When you hire Larry you dont just hire him you get his great team as well. Finally after 2 years of waiting I had a court date set for December 2016 and I was a nervous wreck, but he came through and was able to get my case dismissed. The entire case was tossed out, no jail time, no probation, no nothing! I highly recommend Larry if you or anyone you know is looking for a lawyer. He gave me the best Christmas present I could receive by getting the case tossed out and keeping a clean record!!",

He is an outstanding attorney and is definitely the person you want to represent you if you want to win.  Thank you very much Chad now I can move forward with my life with a clean record . You are the man.",
