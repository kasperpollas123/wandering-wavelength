          <h2>What is Expungement?</h2>
          <p>
            Expungement is a legal process that allows individuals to clear or seal their criminal records from public view. When a record is expunged, it is typically treated as if it never existed for most purposes, such as employment applications, housing applications, and other background checks.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            However, it's important to note that expungement doesn't completely erase a record in all contexts. In many states, expunged records may still be visible to law enforcement agencies, and they may be considered in certain legal proceedings or for specific types of employment.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Types of Record Clearing</h2>
          <p>
            Different states use different terminology and offer various forms of relief for criminal records:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Expungement:</strong> The complete removal or destruction of records</li>
            <li><strong>Record Sealing:</strong> Records are hidden from public view but still exist</li>
            <li><strong>Set Aside:</strong> Conviction is set aside but the record remains</li>

            <li><strong>Certificate of Rehabilitation:</strong> Official document stating rehabilitation, but doesn't remove the record</li>
            <li><strong>Pardon:</strong> Official forgiveness of a crime, typically granted by a governor or president</li>
